# Relay Server — uWebSockets C++ Production Relay

The relay is the ONLY infrastructure component in the entire Hollow distributed system. Every text message, CRDT sync op, MLS key exchange, WebRTC signaling offer, file header, typing indicator, and presence event between peers flows through this single C++ process. It runs on an OVH VPS at `relay.anonlisten.com:443` with native OpenSSL TLS. The relay is zero-knowledge — it routes opaque encrypted payloads between authenticated peers without decrypting or inspecting content.

Source: `relay-uws/src/` (6 source files + 2 headers + `json.hpp`)
Build: CMake, C++20, links against uSockets (static), OpenSSL, libsodium, zlib, pthreads
Binary name: `hollow-relay`

## config.h — Configuration

### Config struct

All fields have defaults and can be overridden via CLI args:

| Field | Default | CLI Flag | Description |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `port` | `443` | `--port` | TLS listen port |
| `public_ip` | (empty) | `--public-ip` | Public IP for signaling responses |
| `domain` | `"relay.anonlisten.com"` | `--domain` | Domain name |
| `keys_file` | `"keys.json"` | `--keys-file` | License keys JSON file path |
| `cert_file` | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.anonlisten.com/fullchain.pem` | `--cert-file` | TLS certificate (fullchain) |
| `key_file` | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.anonlisten.com/privkey.pem` | `--key-file` | TLS private key |
| `turn_secret` | (empty) | env `TURN_SECRET` | HMAC secret for TURN credential generation |

### config.h:parse_args()

Reads CLI flags sequentially. `TURN_SECRET` is loaded from the environment variable (not a CLI arg). Returns a `Config` struct. Calls `print_help()` and `exit(0)` on `--help`.

---

## state.h — Server State

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `MAX_CONNS_PER_IP` | 34 | Max simultaneous WS connections per IP |
| `MAX_NEW_CONNS_PER_MIN_PER_IP` | 10 | Max new connections per minute per IP (sliding window) |
| `MAX_GUEST_ROOMS` | 3 | Max rooms a guest can join |
| `GUEST_IDLE_SECS` | 1800 | Guest idle timeout (30 min no binary activity) |
| `GUEST_BINARY_PER_MIN` | 10 | Max 0x03 binary frames per minute for guests |

### Per-IP keying: `ip_limit_key()` (ws_handler.cpp)

ALL per-IP accounting (connection caps) keys through `ip_limit_key(getRemoteAddressAsText())`:
- IPv4 → the dotted-quad address.
- **v4-MAPPED addresses are unmapped first** — the relay listens dual-stack on `[::]:443`, so every IPv4 client arrives as `::ffff:a.b.c.d` (uWS prints uncompressed v6 hex; uSockets does NOT unmap). Truncating those to /64 without unmapping collapses ALL IPv4 users into one `::/64` bucket → MAX_CONNS_PER_IP becomes a global cap (caught live 2026-07-05).
- Real IPv6 → truncated to the **/64 prefix** (`"2001:db8:1:2::/64"`) — one host owns a whole /64, per-address caps are trivially bypassed.
Any future per-IP feature MUST reuse this helper.

### No byte quotas (2026-08-28)

The 10 GiB/day per-IP byte budget (`DAILY_BYTE_BUDGET`, `bytes_today`/`budget_day`, `get_bandwidth`, the `1008 "bandwidth_limit"` close, `sweep_ip_budgets`) was REMOVED end to end. It metered every binary WS frame both ways (so share audio over `0x03`, sync, asset pulls all counted) while never touching TURN, a separate process. Volume fairness now lives BELOW the relay:

- **CAKE on the host NIC** — `tc qdisc replace dev ens16 root cake bandwidth 950mbit besteffort dual-dsthost` (persisted as `hollow-cake.service`). Per-destination-host fair share engages ONLY when egress saturates; an idle line is free to anyone. `besteffort` ignores DSCP so a client cannot jump the queue by marking packets. 950 Mbit sits ~9 percent under the MEASURED raw ceiling (2026-08-28, cake removed, 32 curl streams, NIC counters: 1047 Mbit egress to Cloudflare `__up`, 882 Mbit ingress from `proof.ovh.net`), because the shaper must be the bottleneck for fairness to exist. With cake on, the same test pins at exactly the configured number. The earlier ~830 figure was the download source throttling; never size the shaper from a single-source test or the nominal port. `/server-stats` reports `bandwidth_cap_mbps` = the shaper ceiling.
- **coturn peer lock** — see the TURN section below. The WS relay was already closed by construction (room-membership gated, no exit to the internet); the lock gives TURN the same shape.

Older clients still send `get_bandwidth` every 30 s; it is an unknown command and falls through silently. Rule stays: abuse is bounded by fair share, NEVER by a cap or a silent drop.

### coturn peer lock (2026-08-28)

`/etc/turnserver.conf` on the VPS (backup `turnserver.conf.bak-2026-08-28`; template in `relay-uws/turnserver.conf.example`):

```
denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255
denied-peer-ip=::-ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
allowed-peer-ip=<relay v4>
allowed-peer-ip=<relay v6, BOTH global addresses>
no-tcp-relay
```

A TURN allocation may only exchange packets with the relay host itself, i.e. another authenticated Hollow client's allocation on the same coturn. Before the lock the live config had NO `denied-peer-ip` at all and TCP relay (RFC 6062) enabled: an open UDP+TCP proxy for anyone holding 1-hour credentials. Calls lose nothing: `relay<->srflx` pairs now fail at CreatePermission (403) and libwebrtc prunes them, ICE settles on `relay<->relay`, same bytes on the line. Verified with `turnutils_uclient -W <secret>` on the VPS: external peer → `channel bind: error 403 (Forbidden IP)`; client-to-client (`-y`) → 20/20; TCP relay (`-T`) → `error 442`. Multi-relay future: every relay's addresses join the allow list (or each relay allows itself + siblings).


### IPv6 (2026-07-05)

Relay serves dual-stack natively (uWS binds `[::]:443` by default). coturn listens on all system addresses both families (`listening-ip` pin removed; `external-ip` removed — public v4 is on-interface, no NAT). DNS: `relay.anonlisten.com` has A + AAAA (`2001:41d0:ab01::4:0:d`, the OVH DHCPv6-stable address). Client code is family-agnostic; libwebrtc gathers v6 ICE automatically. See memory `project_relay_ipv6`.

### PerSocketData (per-connection state)

Attached to every WebSocket via uWebSockets' templated user data. Fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `peer_id` | `std::string` | Hex-encoded Ed25519 public key, set on auth |
| `authenticated` | `bool` | `false` until auth handshake completes |
| `auth_timer` | `us_timer_t*` | 10-second auth timeout timer, nulled after auth or on close |
| `license_key` | `std::string` | The license key this peer authenticated with (empty if license not required) |
| `is_guest` | `bool` | `true` if auth included `"guest": true` flag. Guests are invisible to members, rate-limited, room-capped |
| `ip_key` | `std::string` | Normalized `ip_limit_key` (v4 addr / v6 /64; stored for decrement on close, never logged) |
| `ip_state` | `IpState*` | Cached pointer into `state.ip_states` for zero-lookup per-frame byte accounting (stable: values survive rehash; entry never erased while `active_count > 0`) |
| `last_binary_activity` | `steady_clock::time_point` | Last 0x03 binary frame timestamp (for guest idle timeout) |
| `binary_frames_this_minute` | `uint32_t` | Guest rate limit counter (reset every 60s) |
| `minute_window_start` | `steady_clock::time_point` | Start of current rate limit window |

### IpState (per-IP connection tracking)

In-memory only — never logged, never persisted. Erased on close once `active_count == 0`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `active_count` | `uint32_t` | Currently open connections from this IP |
| `recent_connects` | `deque<steady_clock::time_point>` | Sliding window of connection timestamps for rate limiting |

### PeerEntry (signaling registration)

Used for HTTP-based peer discovery (bootstrap):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `peer_id` | `std::string` | Peer identity |
| `addresses` | `vector<string>` | Network addresses (up to 5) |
| `last_seen` | `uint64_t` | Unix timestamp of last registration |

### WsRoom

```cpp
struct WsRoom {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, SSLWebSocket*> peers;  // peer_id -> ws pointer
};
```

A room is a named group of connected WebSocket peers. Rooms are created implicitly on first join and destroyed when the last peer leaves. The key is the room code string (typically a hex-encoded server ID or DM channel ID).

### ServerStatsCache

Caches `/server-stats` JSON for 5 seconds to avoid re-reading `/proc` on every request:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cached_json` | `string` | Pre-serialized JSON response |
| `fetched_at` | `steady_clock::time_point` | When cache was populated |
| `prev_rx_bytes` / `prev_tx_bytes` | `uint64_t` | Previous sample's network counters |
| `prev_sample_at` | `steady_clock::time_point` | When previous sample was taken |
| `rx_mbps` / `tx_mbps` | `double` | Calculated bandwidth rates |
| `has_prev` | `bool` | Whether a previous sample exists (false on first call) |

`is_fresh()` returns true if cache is less than 5 seconds old.

### RelayState (global server state)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `signaling_rooms` | `unordered_map<string, vector<PeerEntry>>` | HTTP signaling: room_code -> registered peers |
| `ws_rooms` | `unordered_map<string, WsRoom>` | WebSocket rooms: room_code -> room with peer map |
| `peer_rooms` | `unordered_map<string, unordered_set<string>>` | Reverse index: peer_id -> set of room codes they're in |
| `peer_sockets` | `unordered_map<string, SSLWebSocket*>` | peer_id -> WebSocket pointer (for license kicks + online count) |
| `ip_states` | `unordered_map<string, IpState>` | Per-IP connection tracking (in-memory only, never logged) |
| `guest_sockets` | `unordered_set<SSLWebSocket*>` | All guest WebSocket pointers (for idle timeout iteration) |
| `guest_count` | `size_t` | Global guest connection counter |
| `license` | `LicenseState` | License key validation state |
| `stats_cache` | `ServerStatsCache` | Cached stats response |

`online_users()` returns `peer_sockets.size() - guest_count` (guests excluded from the count).

### Backpressure

No soft backpressure limit — removed because it silently dropped CRDT sync messages and broke all offline-to-online flows. Hard limit (64 MB) is set via uWebSockets' `.maxBackpressure` in `setup_ws_handler()` as a safety net for dead connections.

### Type alias

```cpp
using SSLWebSocket = uWS::WebSocket<true, true, struct PerSocketData>;
```

`true, true` = SSL enabled, server-side. Third template param is the per-socket user data type.

---

## main.cpp — Entry Point

### Initialization sequence

1. **`sodium_init()`** — Initialize libsodium. Fatal exit on failure.
2. **`parse_args()`** — Parse CLI args into `Config` struct.
3. **Banner** — Print port and startup info to stderr.
4. **`RelayState` construction** — Default-constructed (all maps empty).
5. **License loading** — `state.license.load_from_file(config.keys_file)`. Non-fatal if missing (license system disabled).
6. **Signal handlers** — `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` set `should_shutdown` atomic bool.

### TLS setup

```cpp
auto app = uWS::SSLApp({
    .key_file_name = config.key_file.c_str(),
    .cert_file_name = config.cert_file.c_str(),
    .ssl_prefer_low_memory_usage = 1,
});
```

- `ssl_prefer_low_memory_usage = 1` enables `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS`, which releases read/write buffers when idle — critical for low per-connection memory (contributes to the 13.4 KB/conn figure).

### TLS session resumption

After app creation, the native `SSL_CTX*` is extracted and configured for server-side session caching:

```cpp
SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(ssl_ctx, SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER);
SSL_CTX_sess_set_cache_size(ssl_ctx, 20000);
```

Reconnecting clients reuse cached TLS session keys for ~10x faster handshakes. Cache holds 20,000 sessions.

### Handler setup

- `setup_ws_handler(app, state)` — Registers the `/ws` WebSocket endpoint.
- `setup_http_handlers(app, state, config)` — Registers all HTTP routes.

### Listen and timers

On successful bind to `config.port`, three timers are created on the uWS event loop:

| Timer | Interval | Callback | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| License reload | 30,000 ms | `s->license.try_reload(*s)` | Hot-reload `keys.json`, kick peers with revoked keys |
| Signaling cleanup | 120,000 ms | `cleanup_stale_signaling(*s)` | Remove HTTP signaling entries older than 180s |
| Guest idle | 60,000 ms | Iterate `guest_sockets`, close idle guests | Disconnect guests with >30 min no binary activity |
| Offline buffer sweep | 300,000 ms | `sweep_offline_buffer`, link codes, link guesses, reports save | TTL expiry of every RAM buffer |
| Shutdown check | 1,000 ms | Check `should_shutdown` atomic | Snapshot, then close timers + every socket (see below) |

Timer state pointers are stored via `us_timer_ext()`; the three periodic timers are also recorded in `g_shutdown.timers` so the shutdown tick can close them.

### main.cpp:cleanup_stale_signaling()

Iterates all `signaling_rooms`, removes `PeerEntry` records where `now - last_seen >= 180` seconds. Deletes empty rooms from the map.

### Graceful shutdown (rewritten 2026-09-07)

When `should_shutdown` is true (from SIGINT/SIGTERM), the 1 s shutdown tick, on the loop thread with every buffer intact:
1. `snapshot_to_fdstore(state)` (see `snapshot.cpp` below).
2. Closes the three periodic timers and itself.
3. `app.close()`: the listen socket plus every connection (`us_socket_context_close` on the HTTP and WS contexts). Close handlers run `cleanup_peer` as usual; the snapshot was taken first because they mutate state.
4. `app.run()` returns, reports are saved, the process exits. Measured 0.7 to 1.8 s.

Until 2026-09-07 step 3 closed only the listen socket. The timers (`fallthrough=0`, counted in `num_polls`) and every open socket kept `us_loop_run` alive, so every restart was a 90 s brownout for new connections ending in systemd's SIGKILL (`State 'stop-sigterm' timed out. Killing.`), and `reports.save_if_dirty()` after `run()` never ran.

Fatal: if the port bind fails, the process calls `exit(1)` immediately.

## snapshot.cpp / snapshot_codec.h / sd_fdstore.h — Restart persistence (2026-09-07)

Everything the relay holds is RAM. A service restart used to empty it: three days of offline DM frames, the topic rings, and every offline phone's push token (RAM-only, never erased on disconnect, re-sent only on app launch). Now the state that an OFFLINE peer cannot re-send rides systemd's file descriptor store across the restart. Memory `project_relay_restart_persistence` has the decisions; this is the shape.

**What is in the snapshot:** `offline_buffer` (room, frame, sender, age, is_image, is_channel, seq), `offline_optin`, `topic_buffers` (key, accepting, retention_secs, registered age, frames), `push_tokens`, `push_prefs`. Not: rooms and sockets, nickname and link-code claims (relay-scoped by design), push debounce counters, `device_list_max_version`, the two files.

**`snapshot_codec.h`** (header-only, no uWS, unit test `test/test_snapshot_codec.cpp`): `snapshot::Data` plus `encode`/`decode`. Magic `HRSN`, `VERSION`, five counted sections, trailer `HRSE`; little-endian fixed-width ints, u32-length strings capped at 64 MB, flags must be 0/1, a count larger than the remaining bytes is refused. `decode` is all-or-nothing: any truncation, bad byte or foreign version returns false and leaves the output untouched. Timestamps travel as AGES in seconds; the reader rebuilds `at = now - age`.

**`sd_fdstore.h`** (header-only): `store(fd, name)` sends `FDSTORE=1\nFDNAME=name` with the fd as SCM_RIGHTS over `NOTIFY_SOCKET` (abstract `@` paths handled); `remove(name)` sends `FDSTOREREMOVE=1`; `take(name)` parses `LISTEN_PID`/`LISTEN_FDS`/`LISTEN_FDNAMES`, marks every passed fd close-on-exec, closes the ones not taken, clears the variables. No libsystemd (its dev package is not on the box).

**`snapshot.cpp`:** `snapshot_to_fdstore` = capture → encode → `memfd_create` → write → `remove` (a stale entry would make the store refuse) → `store` → count-only log line. `restore_from_fdstore` (called in `main` before `listen`) = `take` → `remove` BEFORE parsing (a crashing reader cannot loop on the same snapshot) → `lseek(0)` (the store's dup shares the writer's offset) → read → decode → apply → `sweep_offline_buffer` (what aged out in the gap) → `enforce_buffer_budget` (new export of `evict_over_budget`). `apply` places frames first, then re-stamps the OfflineIndex in ascending old-seq order, DM and topic interleaved, and recomputes `buffer_total_bytes` and each ring's `bytes`.

**Unit requirements** (`deploy/hollow-relay.service` and the box): `NotifyAccess=main`, `FileDescriptorStoreMax=1` (without both systemd drops the datagram), `LimitCORE=0`. `FileDescriptorStorePreserve` stays at its default `restart`: the store survives restarts and is cleared on a full `stop`. Host: NO swap (a 2 GB swapfile was live until 2026-09-07) and apport disabled, because the heap and the memfd are ordinary pageable memory and a core dump is the heap on disk. Docker: no fd store, the handoff no-ops.

**Rules:** a new RAM registry an offline peer cannot re-send joins the codec (bump `VERSION`; an old snapshot is then discarded whole, which is intended). Snapshot BEFORE `app.close()`. Log counts, never keys. Memory peak at shutdown ≈ 3x buffered bytes, at restore ≈ 2x; stream-encode from state before a multi-GB budget.

**Proof:** `scripts/fleet_relay_restart.ps1` (two real instances; b closed, a sends a DM and a channel message and closes, relay restarted with nobody connected, b returns alone and sees both). Journal at that restart: `handed to the fd store: 6 DM frames in 2 queues, 4 topic frames in 2 rings, 2 opt-ins` and `restored ... 10 frames live after expiry`.

---

## crypto.cpp / crypto.h — Cryptographic Operations

### crypto.cpp:verify_ed25519()

Verifies an Ed25519 signature for WebSocket and HTTP authentication.

**Parameters:** `pubkey_b64` (base64-encoded protobuf-wrapped public key), `sig_b64` (base64 signature), `message` (plaintext message that was signed).

**Key format:** The public key is NOT raw 32 bytes. It's a 36-byte protobuf-wrapped key:
- Bytes 0-3: protobuf header `08 01 12 20` (Ed25519 key type tag + 32-byte length prefix)
- Bytes 4-35: raw Ed25519 public key (32 bytes)

This matches the key format used by Hollow's Rust `NativeKeypair` (libp2p-compatible protobuf encoding).

**Process:**
1. Base64-decode `pubkey_b64` into 36 bytes. Reject if length != 36.
2. Validate protobuf header bytes. Reject if wrong.
3. Extract 32-byte Ed25519 key from offset 4.
4. Base64-decode `sig_b64` into 64 bytes. Reject if length != 64.
5. Call `crypto_sign_verify_detached()` (libsodium). Return true on success.

Uses `sodium_base64_VARIANT_ORIGINAL` (standard base64, not URL-safe).

### crypto.cpp:hmac_sha1_base64()

Generates HMAC-SHA1 for TURN credential generation (coturn time-limited credentials protocol).

**Parameters:** `secret` (shared TURN secret), `message` (the username string `"expiry:hollow"`).

**Process:**
1. Compute HMAC-SHA1 using OpenSSL `HMAC()` with `EVP_sha1()`.
2. Base64-encode the 20-byte result using libsodium's `sodium_bin2base64()`.
3. Return the base64 string.

### crypto.cpp:hex_encode()

Converts binary data to lowercase hex string. Used to convert 32-byte binary room IDs from binary WebSocket frames into room code strings for map lookups.

### crypto.cpp:now_unix_secs()

Returns current Unix timestamp in seconds using `std::chrono::system_clock`. Used for timestamp validation, TURN credential expiry, and signaling entry staleness.

---

## reports.cpp / reports.h — User Reports (2026-07-07)

The ONE thing the relay persists about peers — deliberately minimal.

**`ReportsState`** (member of `RelayState` as `state.reports`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `keys` | `unordered_set<string>` | `sha256_hex(reporter '\0' target '\0' category)` — dedup only, one report per (reporter, target, category) |
| `counts` | `unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, uint64_t>>` | target peer_id → category → count (the operator's view) |
| `file_path` | `string` | From `--reports-file` (default `reports.json`, resolves to the systemd WorkingDirectory `/home/ubuntu/relay/`) |
| `dirty` | `bool` | Set by `add()`; cleared on successful save |

- **WS command:** `{"type":"report","target":<peer_id>,"category":<cat>}` → `handle_report()` in ws_handler.cpp (beside `handle_set_offline_buffer`). Guest-guarded; `target` non-empty/≤128/≠self; category allow-list: `spam`, `harassment`, `illegal_content`, `impersonation`. Replies `{"type":"report_ack"}` even on dedup (idempotent from the client's view). NO logging — reporter/target ids are user-identifying.
- **Persistence:** `save_if_dirty()` = nlohmann dump → `.tmp` → `rename()` (atomic); flushed on the 300s sweep timer + after `app.run()` returns (shutdown). `load_from_file()` in main() right after the license load; sets `file_path` even when the file is absent so the first save creates it.
- **Privacy invariant:** who-reported-whom never touches disk or logs — only hashed dedup keys + per-target counts. Cap `MAX_REPORT_KEYS` (500k) bounds RAM/disk.
- **Client path:** FFI `report_user(target, category)` (api/network.rs) → `NodeCommand::ReportUser` → swarm arm → `WsCommand::ReportUser` → `send_command` json arm. One-shot: deliberately NOT cached in `track_room_change`, so never re-sent on reconnect.

## license.cpp / license.h — License Key System

### LicenseResult enum

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Ok` | Key is valid and has been reserved for this peer |
| `NotRequired` | License system is disabled (`enabled = false`) |
| `InvalidKey` | Key not found in the valid key set |
| `KeyInUse` | Key is valid but already bound to a different peer_id |
| `KeyRequired` | License system is enabled but no key was provided |

### LicenseState struct

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | Whether license enforcement is active |
| `keys` | `unordered_set<string>` | Set of valid license key strings |
| `active_keys` | `unordered_map<string, string>` | license_key -> peer_id mapping for in-use keys |
| `file_path` | `string` | Path to keys.json (saved for reload) |
| `last_mtime` | `time_t` | Last modification time of keys.json (for change detection) |

### keys.json format

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "keys": ["key1", "key2", "key3"]
}
```

### license.cpp:load_from_file()

Initial load on startup:
1. Open and read the JSON file.
2. Parse `enabled` boolean (defaults to `false`).
3. Parse `keys` array into the `keys` set.
4. Record `last_mtime` via `stat()` for change detection.
5. Log key count and enabled status to stderr.
6. Returns `false` if file doesn't exist or can't be parsed (non-fatal — license system stays disabled).

### license.cpp:validate_key()

Called during WebSocket auth (`handle_auth()`):
1. If `!enabled`, return `NotRequired` (all peers connect freely).
2. If no key provided (`key == nullptr || key->empty()`), return `KeyRequired`.
3. If key not in `keys` set, return `InvalidKey`.
4. If key is in `active_keys` mapped to a DIFFERENT peer_id, return `KeyInUse`.
5. Otherwise, bind the key to this peer_id in `active_keys` and return `Ok`.

One key can be reused by the same peer_id (reconnection). One key cannot be shared across different peer_ids simultaneously.

### license.cpp:release_key()

Called when a peer disconnects (`cleanup_peer()`). Iterates `active_keys` and removes all entries where `value == peer_id`. A peer could theoretically hold multiple keys (though the current client sends only one).

### license.cpp:try_reload()

Called every 30 seconds by the license reload timer:
1. `stat()` the keys file. If `st_mtime == last_mtime`, return (no change).
2. Re-read and parse the JSON file.
3. Build a new key set.
4. **Revocation check:** For every `(license_key, peer_id)` in `active_keys`, if `license_key` is NOT in the new key set, add `peer_id` to `peers_to_kick`.
5. Update `enabled`, `keys`, and `last_mtime`.
6. Remove kicked peers from `active_keys`.
7. **Active connection revocation:** For each peer to kick, look up their `SSLWebSocket*` in `state.peer_sockets`, send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"invalid_license_key"}`, and call `ws->end(1008, "license_revoked")`. This triggers the close handler which calls `cleanup_peer()`.

The 30-second reload cycle means key revocation takes at most 30 seconds to take effect on active connections.

## ws_handler.cpp / ws_handler.h — WebSocket Handler

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `TIMESTAMP_SKEW_SECS` | 60 | Max allowed clock skew for auth timestamps |
| `MAX_ROOMS_PER_PEER` | 2000 | Maximum rooms a single peer can join |

### ws_handler.cpp:setup_ws_handler() — WebSocket endpoint configuration

Registers the `/ws` endpoint with these settings:

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `.compression` | `uWS::DISABLED` | No per-message compression (content is already encrypted) |
| `.maxPayloadLength` | `64 * 1024 * 1024` (64 MB) | Maximum single message size. NEVER lower — ChannelSyncBatch can exceed 2 MB after MLS+base64. Silently kills connections if exceeded. |
| `.idleTimeout` | `120` seconds | Connection closed if no data (including pings) for 120s |
| `.maxBackpressure` | `64 * 1024 * 1024` (64 MB) | Hard backpressure limit — uWS force-closes truly dead connections at this threshold |
| `.sendPingsAutomatically` | `true` | uWS sends WebSocket pings automatically |

### Connection lifecycle

#### .open handler

When a new WebSocket connects:
1. Initialize `rate_last_refill` to `now`.
2. Create a 10-second one-shot timer (`auth_timer`). If the peer hasn't authenticated within 10 seconds:
   - Detach `auth_timer` pointer from `PerSocketData` BEFORE calling `end()` (prevents double-free since `end()` triggers the close handler).
   - Send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"Authentication failed"}`.
   - Close with code 1008 reason "auth_timeout".
   - Close the timer.

#### .message handler

1. If `!authenticated`: route to `handle_auth()`. First message MUST be auth.
2. If `TEXT` opcode: reject if >1 MB (silent drop). Route to `handle_text_message()`.
3. If `BINARY` opcode:
   - Dispatch on first byte:
     - `0x01` -> UNHANDLED (removed 2026-08; see below)
     - `0x02` -> `handle_binary_direct()` — peer-to-peer direct via NUL-delimited fields
     - `0x03` -> `handle_binary_msg()` — room broadcast via NUL-delimited room string
     - `0x04` -> `handle_binary_direct_msg()` — peer-to-peer direct via NUL-delimited fields
   - Unknown first bytes are silently ignored.

#### .drain handler

Empty (no-op).

#### .close handler

1. If `auth_timer` is set, close it and null the pointer.
2. If `authenticated`, call `cleanup_peer()` to remove from all rooms and notify peers.

### ws_handler.cpp:handle_auth() — Authentication

Authentication protocol (first message after WebSocket open):

**Expected JSON:**
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "peer_id": "<hex-encoded Ed25519 public key>",
  "public_key": "<base64-encoded protobuf-wrapped Ed25519 public key>",
  "timestamp": <unix_seconds>,
  "signature": "<base64-encoded Ed25519 signature>",
  "license_key": "<optional license key string>"
}
```

**Validation steps:**
1. Parse JSON. Reject on parse failure.
2. Check `type == "auth"`. Reject otherwise.
3. Validate `peer_id`, `public_key`, `signature` are non-empty. Reject if any missing.
4. Check timestamp skew: `|now - timestamp| <= 60s`. Reject if too far.
5. **SECURITY — bind `peer_id` to `public_key`:** recompute the peer_id via `derive_peer_id(public_key)` (crypto.cpp) and reject any mismatch. A peer_id is an identity multihash that INLINES the Ed25519 public key, so it is a pure function of that key. Without this check, step 6 proves only that the sender holds the private half of the key they supplied — NOT that they own the peer_id they claim. Anyone could mint a throwaway keypair, sign `hollow-ws-auth:<victim_peer_id>:<ts>` with it, and authenticate AS the victim; since a newer socket for an existing peer_id EVICTS the incumbent, that is a persistent remote deauth of any user (peer_ids are public — broadcast in `peer_joined` + member snapshots). Added 0.8.2 after an external report; the same check also guards both legacy HTTP register/unregister endpoints. **The derivation is duplicated in Rust and C++ and is pinned by matching known-answer tests** (`peer_id_derivation_known_answer` / `relay-uws/test/test_derive_peer_id.cpp`) — silent drift fails auth for EVERY client, so change both or neither.
6. Build signed message: `"hollow-ws-auth:" + peer_id + ":" + timestamp`.
7. Verify Ed25519 signature via `verify_ed25519()`. Reject if invalid.
7. Validate license key via `state.license.validate_key()`. Handle all `LicenseResult` cases:
   - `Ok` / `NotRequired`: continue.
   - `InvalidKey`: send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"invalid_license_key"}`, close with "bad_license".
   - `KeyInUse`: send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"license_key_in_use"}`, close with "bad_license".
   - `KeyRequired`: send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"license_key_required"}`, close with "bad_license".

**On success:**
1. Set `data->peer_id`, `data->authenticated = true`, `data->license_key`.
2. Cancel auth timeout timer.
3. Register peer in `state.peer_rooms[peer_id]` (empty room set) and `state.peer_sockets[peer_id]`.
4. Send `{"type":"auth_ok"}`.

All auth failures send `{"type":"auth_failed","error":"Authentication failed"}` (generic, no information leak) except license-specific errors which have distinct error strings. Close code is always 1008.

### ws_handler.cpp:is_valid_room_code()

Room code validation:
- Not empty, max 128 characters.
- Allowed characters: alphanumeric, `:`, `-`, `_`, `.`.

### ws_handler.cpp:send_json()

Helper: serializes `nlohmann::json` to string and sends as TEXT opcode. No backpressure check (used for control messages).

### ws_handler.cpp:send_to_peer()

The CRITICAL message delivery function. All routed messages go through this:

```cpp
ws->send(data, op);
```

No soft limit — sends unconditionally. `maxBackpressure` (64 MB) is the only safety net for dead connections. Previous soft limit (2 MB) silently dropped CRDT sync responses and broke all offline-to-online flows.

### ws_handler.cpp:handle_join() — Room join

**Input:** `{"type":"join","room":"<room_code>"}`

**Process:**
1. Validate room code via `is_valid_room_code()`.
2. Check peer hasn't exceeded `MAX_ROOMS_PER_PEER` (2000). Error if so.
3. Collect list of existing peer IDs in the room.
4. Add this peer to `ws_rooms[room].peers[peer_id]`.
5. Add room to `peer_rooms[peer_id]`.
6. Send `members` message to the joiner containing ALL peers (including self):
   ```json
   {"type":"members","room":"<room>","peers":["peer1","peer2","self"]}
   ```
7. Send `peer_joined` to every OTHER peer in the room — **but ONLY on a genuine join, not a redundant re-join (2026-07-09).** `handle_join` captures `already_present = ws_room.peers.find(peer_id) != end()` BEFORE the map insert; the `peer_joined` broadcast is gated `&& !already_present`. A client re-joins a room it never left (the PeerLeft "still listed → refreshing membership" path fires a JoinRoom per still-shared room); re-broadcasting `peer_joined` on those re-fires the other side's FULL discovery cascade (profile + key-exchange + sync), looping ~10x in seconds during a fresh friend handshake's room churn — which widened the DM/friend establishment races. The joiner still gets its `members` reply (step 6) for stale-membership reconciliation. **This is the ONLY relay change deployed in the 2026-07 establishment-bug fix pass** (byte-identical binary swap on the OG TLS relay). See `feedback_dm_friend_establishment_bugs_2026_07.md`.
   ```json
   {"type":"peer_joined","room":"<room>","peer_id":"<joiner>"}
   ```

Room creation is implicit — joining a room that doesn't exist creates it.

### ws_handler.cpp:leave_room() — Room leave

Called explicitly via `{"type":"leave","room":"..."}` or implicitly on disconnect.

**Process:**
1. Remove peer from `ws_rooms[room].peers`.
2. If room is now empty, delete it from `ws_rooms`.
3. Remove room from `peer_rooms[peer_id]`.
4. If room still has peers, send `peer_left` to all remaining:
   ```json
   {"type":"peer_left","room":"<room>","peer_id":"<leaver>"}
   ```

**`suppress_peer_left` (2026-08-15).** `leave_room(state, peer, room, expected_ws,
suppress_peer_left)` — when true, step 4 is SKIPPED and `diag.ghost_left_suppressed`
increments instead. Passed `true` from exactly one call site: the `handle_auth`
supersede path, where a NEWER socket for the same `peer_id` is authenticating and
the "leaver" is demonstrably still present. Broadcasting a departure there is a lie
observers act on (it tore down live media branches after an app restart, which is
why the client and forwarder engine both carry presence-flap tolerance).

Two constraints that are easy to break:
- It must be an EXPLICIT flag: the supersede cleanup runs BEFORE
  `peer_sockets[peer_id]` is re-pointed at the new socket, so any "is there a newer
  socket?" inference is false there.
- The room slot is still ERASED — only the broadcast is withheld. A slot left
  pointing at a closed socket is a dangling pointer on every later fan-out; the
  successor's re-join restores presence via `peer_joined`.

Also fixed in `handle_auth` the same day: `peer_rooms[peer_id] = {}` was outside the
`!is_fetch` guard, so a fetch-mode auth wiped a connected full node's room set (its
close then never called `leave_room`, leaving room slots on a freed socket).

### ws_handler.cpp:handle_msg() — Room text broadcast

**Input:** `{"type":"msg","room":"<room>","data":"<payload>"}`

**Process:**
1. Find the room. Return silently if room doesn't exist.
2. Verify the sender is a member of the room. Return silently if not.
3. Broadcast to ALL other peers in the room:
   ```json
   {"type":"msg","room":"<room>","from":"<sender_peer_id>","data":"<payload>"}
   ```

The `data` field contains opaque encrypted content (MLS ciphertext, Olm ciphertext, plaintext HavenMessage JSON — the relay doesn't know or care).

### ws_handler.cpp:handle_direct() — Peer-to-peer text direct

**Input:** `{"type":"direct","room":"<room>","target":"<target_peer_id>","data":"<payload>"}`

**Process:**
1. Find the room. Return silently if not found.
2. Verify sender is in the room. Return silently if not.
3. Find target in the room. Return silently if not found.
4. Send to target only:
   ```json
   {"type":"direct","room":"<room>","from":"<sender_peer_id>","data":"<payload>"}
   ```

Used for: Olm key exchange (DMs), WebRTC signaling offers/answers, friend requests, direct sync probes.

### ws_handler.cpp:handle_text_message() — Text message dispatcher

Parses JSON and dispatches on `type` field:
- `"join"` -> `handle_join()`
- `"leave"` -> `leave_room()`
- `"msg"` -> `handle_msg()`
- `"direct"` -> `handle_direct()`
- `"check_peers"` -> inline handler: accepts `peers` (array of peer IDs), does O(1) hashmap lookups against `peer_sockets`, returns `{"type":"peer_status","online":[...],"active_rooms":[]}`. Used by the 60s client-side peer liveness timer for offline friend self-healing. Deliberately UNTHROTTLED: peer ids are high-entropy (not enumerable blind), the reply only restates what routing already exposes, and a cap would silently degrade the liveness check that heals offline-friend state. **The `rooms` probe was REMOVED 2026-08** (issue #46): it reported whether an arbitrary room code held any peers, and DM room codes are a deterministic function of the two master peer_ids — so anyone holding two peer_ids could ask the relay whether those two people were talking. `active_rooms` is now always `[]`; the field stays on the wire only because `ServerMsg::PeerStatus` needs it to deserialize on older clients (it is `#[serde(default)]` from 0.9.4). Never reintroduce a room-state lookup keyed on a caller-supplied room code.
- `"discover_peers"` -> inline handler: accepts `room`, returns `{"type":"discovered_peers","room":..,"peers":[...]}` listing the room's `ws_rooms` peers (excluding self). Replaces the HTTP `/bootstrap` poll for peer discovery so it rides the live WS connection instead of paying a fresh TLS handshake per request (which could stall under a WS frame burst on the single event loop). Cheap: one map lookup + bounded copy, no blocking I/O. Client side: `WsCommand::DiscoverPeers` / `WsEvent::DiscoveredPeers`. (Since 2026-07 this IS peer discovery — the client's HTTP signaling task was deleted; the relay keeps the HTTP endpoints for old clients.) **MEMBERS ONLY since 2026-08** (issue #46): the requester must be in the room. It previously answered for any room code, making it a roster dump — hand it a deterministic DM room code and it returned exactly who was in that DM. Clients only ever discover in rooms they have already joined (`active_room` + their own server ids), so the gate costs nothing legitimate.
- `"get_turn_credentials"` (2026-07) -> inline handler: HMAC-SHA1 time-limited TURN credentials over the AUTHENTICATED socket — same generation as HTTP `/turn-credentials` (username `{expiry}:hollow`, ttl 3600, 3 URIs) but guest sockets get `{"error":"auth required"}` and no open farmable endpoint is involved. Returns `{"type":"turn_credentials",username,password,ttl,uris[]}`. `setup_ws_handler`/`handle_text_message` now take `const Config&` for `turn_secret`. Client side: `WsCommand::GetTurnCredentials` on connect + 50-min refresh → `NetworkEvent::TurnCredentials` → Dart `iceConfigProvider`.
- `"subscribe"` -> `handle_subscribe()`

Unknown types are silently ignored. Invalid JSON is silently ignored.

### Binary message protocol

Binary messages use a type-byte prefix system for zero-copy routing. Four binary message types exist:

#### Type 0x01 — Binary room broadcast (hash-addressed) — REMOVED 2026-08

**Frame was:** `[0x01][32-byte room hash][payload]`

`handle_binary_broadcast()` is **gone**, and `0x01` is now an unhandled opcode.

It was the one binary handler that never checked room membership at all: it
hex-encoded the caller-supplied 32-byte room hash, looked the room up, and
forwarded the frame verbatim to every peer in it. Anyone authenticated who knew
a room code could therefore inject frames into a room they had never joined.

Nothing sent it. Server broadcasts moved to `0x03` (`handle_binary_msg`, which
is membership-gated) when room codes became NUL-delimited strings; the Rust
client emits only `0x02/0x03/0x04/0x07/0x08/0x09`. Reported publicly via a
semgrep sweep in issue #46. Do not reintroduce a hash-addressed broadcast
without a membership check.

#### Type 0x02 — Binary peer-to-peer direct

**Frame:** `[0x02][room_code\0][target_peer_id\0][payload]`

`handle_binary_direct()`:
1. Parse room code (from offset 1 to first NUL).
2. Parse target peer ID (from after first NUL to second NUL).
3. Extract payload (everything after second NUL).
4. **Rewrite the frame:** Replace the target peer ID with the sender's peer ID, so the receiver knows who sent it:
   ```
   Forwarded: [0x02][room_code\0][sender_peer_id\0][payload]
   ```
5. Route to the target peer only.

Used for: Olm-encrypted DM payloads, WebRTC binary signaling, file stream chunks.

#### Type 0x03 — Binary room broadcast (string-addressed)

**Frame:** `[0x03][room_code\0][payload]`

`handle_binary_msg()`:
1. Parse room code (from offset 1 to NUL).
2. Verify sender is in the room.
3. **Rewrite to type 0x05:** Build forwarded frame:
   ```
   Forwarded: [0x05][room_code\0][sender_peer_id\0][payload]
   ```
4. Broadcast to all other peers in the room.

The type change from 0x03 to 0x05 lets receivers distinguish "this is a forwarded broadcast" from "this is a client-originated broadcast." The sender's peer_id is injected by the relay (cannot be spoofed by the sender).

#### Type 0x04 — Binary peer-to-peer direct (string-addressed)

**Frame:** `[0x04][room_code\0][target_peer_id\0][payload]`

`handle_binary_direct_msg()`:
1. Parse room code (from offset 1 to first NUL).
2. Parse target peer ID.
3. Extract payload.
4. Verify sender is in the room.
5. Verify target is in the room.
6. **Rewrite to type 0x06:** Build forwarded frame:
   ```
   Forwarded: [0x06][room_code\0][sender_peer_id\0][payload]
   ```
7. Route to target peer only.

The type change from 0x04 to 0x06 lets receivers distinguish forwarded direct messages. Sender identity is relay-injected.

### Binary type byte summary

| Client sends | Relay forwards as | Mode | Room addressing |
|-------------|-------------------|------|-----------------|
| `0x01` | — (REMOVED, unhandled) | — | — |
| `0x02` | `0x02` (target->sender rewrite) | Direct | NUL-delimited string |
| `0x03` | `0x05` (type change + sender inject) | Broadcast | NUL-delimited string |
| `0x04` | `0x06` (type change + sender inject) | Direct | NUL-delimited string |
| `0x08` | `0x06` (same as 0x04) | Direct (image) | NUL-delimited string |

Every surviving type rewrites the routing header to inject the AUTHENTICATED sender, so a client cannot forge who a frame came from at the relay layer. (The removed `0x01` was the one exception — it forwarded verbatim.) `0x08` is identical to `0x04` on the wire/forward path — the only difference is the offline buffer tags it `is_image` so it counts against the per-peer image cap (1) instead of the text cap (100). Used for offline inlined-image delivery (see Push notifications section).

### ws_handler.cpp — Binary rate limiting (REMOVED)

Previously used a token bucket algorithm (removed — broke reconnection bursts):
- Bucket capacity: 100 tokens.
- Refill rate: 20 tokens/second.
- Cost: 1 token per binary message.
- On each binary message, calculate elapsed time since last refill, add `elapsed * 20` tokens (capped at 100), then consume 1 token.
- If bucket is empty (0 tokens), the message is silently dropped (no error sent to client).

This limits binary messages to a burst of 100 + sustained 20/second. Text messages have a 1 MB size cap but are NOT rate-limited (text frames are only small JSON commands: join/leave/subscribe, and the reconnection burst is too heavy to cap without breaking sync).

### ws_handler.cpp:cleanup_peer() — Disconnect cleanup

Called from the close handler when an authenticated peer disconnects:
1. `state.license.release_key(peer_id)` — Free the license key.
2. `state.peer_sockets.erase(peer_id)` — Remove from global socket map.
3. Copy the peer's room set (since `leave_room` modifies it during iteration).
4. Call `leave_room()` for each room — removes peer from room, notifies remaining peers with `peer_left`, deletes empty rooms.
5. `state.peer_rooms.erase(peer_id)` — Remove reverse index.

## http_handlers.cpp / http_handlers.h — HTTP Endpoints

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `MAX_PEERS_PER_ROOM` | 50 | Max signaling peers per room |
| `MAX_ADDRS_PER_PEER` | 5 | Max addresses per peer registration |
| `STALE_THRESHOLD_SECS` | 180 | Entries older than 3 min are stale |
| `TIMESTAMP_SKEW_SECS` | 60 | Max clock skew for signed requests |
| `MAX_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` | 10 | Max peers returned by bootstrap |

### CORS

All HTTP responses include:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json
```

A global OPTIONS handler at `/*` responds with:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

### POST /register — Peer registration (signaling)

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "room_code": "<string, max 64 chars>",
  "peer_id": "<string>",
  "addresses": ["addr1", "addr2"],
  "timestamp": <unix_seconds>,
  "public_key": "<base64 protobuf Ed25519 public key>",
  "signature": "<base64 Ed25519 signature>"
}
```

**Signed message format:** `"hollow-register:" + room_code + ":" + peer_id + ":" + addresses_joined + ":" + timestamp`

Where `addresses_joined` is comma-separated (e.g., `"addr1,addr2"`).

**Process:**
1. Validate `room_code` (non-empty, max 64), `addresses` (non-empty), `peer_id`, `public_key`, `signature`.
2. Check timestamp skew (<= 60s).
3. Truncate addresses to 5 entries.
4. Verify Ed25519 signature.
5. Clean stale entries (>= 180s old) from the room.
6. Upsert: if peer already registered, update addresses and timestamp. If new:
   - If room is full (>= 50 peers), evict the oldest entry.
   - Add new entry.
7. Return `{"ok":true,"peers_in_room":<count>}`.

**Error responses:** 400 for validation, 403 for timestamp skew or bad signature.

Uses `res->onData()` streaming pattern for POST body (uWebSockets doesn't buffer POST bodies by default).

### POST /unregister — Peer unregistration (signaling)

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "room_code": "<string>",
  "peer_id": "<string>",
  "timestamp": <unix_seconds>,
  "public_key": "<base64 key>",
  "signature": "<base64 signature>"
}
```

**Signed message format:** `"hollow-unregister:" + room_code + ":" + peer_id + ":" + timestamp`

**Process:**
1. Validate fields, check timestamp, verify signature (same as register).
2. Find the room in `signaling_rooms`.
3. Remove the entry with matching `peer_id`.
4. If the room is now empty, delete it.
5. Return `{"ok":true}`.

### GET /bootstrap/:room_code — Peer discovery

**URL parameter:** `room_code` (max 64 chars).

**Process:**
1. Look up room in `signaling_rooms`.
2. If not found, return `{"peers":[]}`.
3. Iterate entries, skip stale ones (>= 180s old).
4. Return up to `MAX_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` (10) entries:
   ```json
   {"peers":[{"peer_id":"...","addresses":["..."]}]}
   ```

No authentication required — room codes are unguessable (derived from server/channel IDs).

### GET /health — Health check

Returns: `{"status":"ok","service":"hollow-signaling"}`

No authentication, no state access. Used for uptime monitoring.

### GET /turn-credentials — REMOVED 2026-08

**This route is gone.** It handed valid time-limited TURN credentials to any
unauthenticated caller, so the TURN service was farmable by anyone for free
relay bandwidth against the per-IP daily budget (issue #46). Credentials are
issued ONLY over the authenticated non-guest WebSocket
(`"get_turn_credentials"`), which has been the client path since 0.7.1
(2026-07-03). Do not add an HTTP variant back: there is no caller identity at
the HTTP layer to bind a credential to. `setup_http_handlers` still takes a
`const Config&` (now unused) so the signature stays stable.

The generation itself (unchanged, now WS-only):
1. If `config.turn_secret` is empty, return 503 `{"error":"TURN not configured"}`.
2. Calculate expiry: `now + 3600` (1 hour TTL).
3. Build username: `"<expiry>:hollow"` (coturn time-limited format).
4. Compute password: `HMAC-SHA1(turn_secret, username)` base64-encoded. HMAC-SHA1
   is REQUIRED here by the coturn/TURN REST API spec — semgrep flags it as a
   weak hash, but it cannot be changed unilaterally without breaking TURN auth.
5. Return:
   ```json
   {
     "username": "1714876800:hollow",
     "password": "<base64 HMAC>",
     "ttl": 3600,
     "uris": [
       "turn:relay.anonlisten.com:3478",
       "turn:relay.anonlisten.com:3478?transport=tcp",
       "turns:relay.anonlisten.com:5349"
     ]
   }
   ```

The three TURN URIs cover: UDP (fastest), TCP fallback, and TLS-wrapped (for restrictive networks). The Dart client MUST split these into separate `IceServer` entries due to flutter_webrtc's native `CreateIceServers` limitations.

### GET /server-stats — Server statistics

Returns real-time server resource utilization. Cached for 5 seconds.

**Data sources (Linux-specific):**
- `/proc/meminfo` — `MemTotal` and `MemAvailable` (in KB).
- `/proc/net/dev` — Network interface `ens16` (OVH VPS interface name) rx/tx byte counters.

**Bandwidth calculation:**
- Compares current byte counters with previous sample.
- Calculates Mbps: `(delta_bytes * 8) / (elapsed_seconds * 1,000,000)`.
- Skips calculation if elapsed < 0.5s (uses previous values).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "mem_total_kb": 8167352,
  "mem_used_kb": 1234567,
  "rx_mbps": 12.34,
  "tx_mbps": 5.67,
  "bandwidth_cap_mbps": 1000,
  "online_users": 42
}
```

`bandwidth_cap_mbps` is hardcoded to 1000 (the OVH VPS public bandwidth allocation — OVH lifted the port from 400 Mbps to 1 Gbps for free in Aug 2026 as part of a product-range change; measured 854 Mbps down / 827 Mbps up after the required reboot). It is NOT measured at runtime — `virtio_net` reports no link speed, so bump this constant by hand if the port ever changes again. `online_users` comes from `state.peer_sockets.size() - guest_count` (excludes guest connections).

### GET /relay-status — Relay status for client bootstrap

**Response:**
```json
{
  "license_required": true,
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

The Dart client checks this endpoint on startup. If `license_required` is true and the user hasn't cached a key, the app shows the license key input dialog.

## BENCHMARK.md — Performance Data

### Test environment

OVH VPS: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, Ubuntu. Relay is single-threaded epoll.

### Test methodology

Custom Rust stress test tool (`bench/stress_test/`):
- Each connection: open TLS WebSocket, authenticate with unique Ed25519 keypair, hold idle.
- Ramp: batches of 500, 100 concurrent TLS handshakes.
- Measurement: relay process RSS via `ps -o rss=` at 5-second intervals.
- Client uses `rustls` with shared `ClientConfig` (~28 KB/conn client-side vs ~700 KB with OpenSSL).

### Key results

- **13.4 KB per connection** (stabilized from 15k to 44.6k, perfectly linear).
- **44,600 simultaneous connections** — bottleneck was client-side port exhaustion, NOT relay capacity.
- **0 connection failures, 0 drops.**
- **Single-threaded** — all 44.6k connections on one epoll thread.

### Capacity estimates

| VPS RAM | Max Connections |
|---------|-----------------|
| 8 GB | ~572,000 |
| 12 GB | ~878,000 |
| 16 GB | ~1,183,000 |

Based on 13.4 KB/conn with ~200 MB reserved for OS + relay baseline.

### Memory progression

RSS grows linearly: 45 MB at 1k connections -> 614 MB at 44.6k. No memory cliffs, fragmentation, or degradation.

### System tuning for high connection counts

```bash
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = "1024 65535"
ulimit -n 500000
```

## Message flow: complete path of a chat message

1. Sender's Rust `node/` encrypts the message with MLS and sends a binary frame: `[0x03][server_id\0][MLS ciphertext]`.
2. Rust `ws_client.rs` sends this over the WSS connection to `relay.anonlisten.com:443/ws`.
3. Relay's `.message` handler receives it as `BINARY` opcode.
4. First byte is `0x03` -> `handle_binary_msg()`.
6. The NUL-delimited room code (server ID) is read from offset 1.
7. The room is looked up in `ws_rooms`, and the SENDER must be a member of it.
8. The frame is rebuilt as `0x05` with the authenticated sender injected, then forwarded via `send_to_peer()` to every other peer in the room.
9. `send_to_peer()` checks each recipient's `getBufferedAmount()` < 2 MB soft limit.
10. Each recipient's Rust `ws_client.rs` receives the binary frame, strips the type byte and room hash, decrypts with MLS.

## Docker self-hosting

Files in `relay-uws/`: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `turnserver.conf.example`.

Docker Compose runs three services:
- **relay** — builds from Dockerfile (multi-stage: debian bookworm build → slim runtime), TLS on port 443, certs from shared volume
- **certbot** — auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certs, renews every 12h, copies to shared volume
- **coturn** — TURN server on host network (ports 3478/5349)

Self-hoster setup: `cp .env.example .env` (edit domain/IP/secret), `cp turnserver.conf.example turnserver.conf` (edit realm/secret), `docker compose up -d`.

The relay binary is SSL-only (`uWS::SSLApp`) — cannot run without TLS certs. No `--no-tls` mode exists. This is intentional: every self-hosted relay is TLS-secured by default.

## Push notifications & offline message buffer (FCM Tier 2)

The relay is normally a dumb pipe, but to make FCM push notifications deliver real message content it holds offline DMs briefly in RAM.

**State (`RelayState`, state.h):**
- `push_tokens`: `peer_id -> {token, platform}`. Registered via `register_push_token` WS message (`handle_register_push_token`). RAM only, re-registered each app launch.
- `last_push_sent`: `peer_id -> time_point`. Debounce, `PUSH_DEBOUNCE_SECS = 10` (was 30). Throttles FCM call rate only — does NOT drop messages (the buffer keeps them). NOTE: rapid-fire sends within the debounce window suppress later FCM wakes, so some Tier-2 previews won't run until the next un-debounced send — looks flaky under burst testing, fine under normal use.
- `offline_buffer`: `peer_id -> deque<BufferedMsg{room, frame, sender, at, is_image, is_channel}>`. **FAIR-SHARE eviction since 2026-08** (issue #46): when a per-peer cap is hit, `drop_oldest_kind` drops the oldest frame belonging to whichever sender currently occupies the MOST slots of that kind — not the globally oldest. With one sender this is byte-for-byte the old behaviour; under contention a flooder can only evict ITSELF. Without it the per-peer caps bounded RAM but not WHO filled it, so one authenticated peer could buffer 100 frames at any peer_id it knew and evict every genuine message waiting there. **Deliberately NOT a flat per-sender cap and NOT rate limited** — the per-peer caps are legitimately reachable by one sender (500 opted-in), and a per-minute limit would silently drop reconnection bursts and large-server `0x09` fan-out. Both are the message-loss class `feedback_relay_rules` forbids. Each `frame` is a ready-to-send `0x06` direct frame (ciphertext only). **Independent per-peer caps**: baseline `MAX_BUFFERED_MSGS_PER_PEER = 100` (text) and `MAX_BUFFERED_IMAGES_PER_PEER = 1`; **opted-in peers** (message-availability cache, `set_offline_buffer {enabled, retention_secs}` JSON, registry `offline_optin: peer -> retention_secs` clamped 1h..7d, re-sent by ws_client on every reconnect) get `MAX_OPTIN_MSGS_PER_PEER = 500` and `MAX_OPTIN_IMAGES_PER_PEER = 8` with THEIR retention at sweep (images always ≤24h — inlined bytes never ride extended retention). Baseline `OFFLINE_BUFFER_TTL_SECS = 86400` (24h). All buffered bytes count into `buffer_total_bytes` against `MAX_BUFFER_TOTAL_BYTES = 512MB` (oldest-front global eviction, `evict_over_budget`).

**Flow (ws_handler.cpp):**
1. `handle_binary_direct_msg` (0x04 text / **0x08 image**) / `handle_direct` (text): target offline (`peer_sockets` miss) → `buffer_offline_msg(.., is_image)` stores the `0x06` frame → `try_push_notify()` → `notify_push_sidecar()` enqueues `{token, platform, sender}` for the push worker. `buffer_offline_msg` evicts oldest of each kind independently (`count_kind`/`drop_oldest_kind`) so an image burst never pushes out buffered text. **Push delivery uses a SINGLE persistent worker thread + bounded queue (`PUSH_QUEUE_MAX`), NOT a detached thread per push** — `notify_push_sidecar()` lazily starts one worker (`push_worker_loop`) that drains the queue and does the blocking POST to localhost:3001. The POST carries `X-Push-Token` when `HOLLOW_PUSH_TOKEN` is set (sidecar side: `PUSH_TOKEN`, constant-time compare, 401 on mismatch) — the sidecar holds the Firebase Admin credential, so loopback binding limits reachability but not authorization, and any local process could otherwise push to arbitrary device tokens (issue #46). Unset on either side = open, so the two can be deployed independently. Per-push thread spawning previously caused churn during DM/file-sync bursts (each POST is a blocking connect/send/recv with 2s timeouts). Queue overflow drops oldest (push is best-effort; the DM still delivers via the offline buffer).
2. The peer's FCM fetch node (or full node) later joins the DM room → `handle_join` calls `replay_buffered_msgs()` → sends ALL buffered frames for that room (text + image, both as 0x06), drops delivered entries.
3. `sweep_offline_buffer()` (5-min timer in main.cpp) evicts entries older than 24h.

**Inlined-image delivery (0x08):** An image DM is two wire messages: the text DM (carries only `file_id`) and a separate FileHeader (metadata + AES key) + streamed bytes. The stream is NEVER sent to an offline peer. So for offline images the **sender inlines the AES-encrypted bytes (base64) into the FileHeader's `inline_bytes` field** and sends the Olm-encrypted FileHeader via a **`0x08` SendDirectImage** frame (ws_client.rs `SendDirectImage`, crypto_handler.rs `send_encrypted_image_to_peer` — targets `dm_room_code(local,peer)` DIRECTLY since an offline peer is in no room). The relay buffers it under the image cap. The fetch node (`fetch.rs`) parses `MessageEnvelope::FileHeader`, decrypts the inline bytes, writes `files/{fid}.{ext}`, and **inserts the `messages` row itself** (`[file:{fid}]`, INSERT OR IGNORE) + `insert_file_metadata` + `mark_file_complete` — because the companion text DM is dropped to offline peers. Guests blocked from 0x08.

**Caption (offline captioned image):** sent EXACTLY ONCE via `crypto_handler::send_encrypted_text_to_peer` (a `0x04` SendDirect straight to the DM room, buffered under the TEXT cap, independent of the image cap), AFTER the FileHeader. It is NOT sent via the normal `send_encrypted_message` for an offline image — that helper calls `olm.encrypt()` (advancing+persisting the ratchet) BEFORE checking reachability and then discards the ciphertext if offline, burning a ratchet slot the receiver never sees → a permanent decrypt gap. `file_handler.rs` gates this with `offline_image = !reachable && is_image`. The caption shares the FileHeader's `mid`; `fetch.rs` merges the two entries (real caption text wins over the `[file:...]` sentinel; `promote_file_sentinel_to_caption` updates text+sig+pk when the FileHeader's row won the insert race).

**Signature:** the message-row sig canonically rides on the DirectMessage envelope (the FileHeader handler ignores sig on the online path). For offline images the offline FileHeader carries `sig`/`pk` (captionless: the ONLY sig carrier, signed over `[file:<id>]`); otherwise the row renders "Unsigned".

**Notification render:** NO BigPicture photo preview (removed — decode+downscale on the notif thread was too slow). The image still syncs to the DB; the banner shows a lightweight line — `📷 Image` (captionless) or `📷 <caption>` (caption present, gated on `image_path != null`). iOS: works once APNs is configured (same path).

**Fetch-mode peers** (`is_fetch`, set from `fetch:true` in Auth): excluded from `peer_sockets`, `PeerJoined`, member lists — invisible, so waking via push doesn't show the user online. Buffer replay works for them via `handle_join`.

### Message-availability cache (opt-in offline delivery, 2026-07-04)

Generalizes the push buffer into user-facing offline delivery. **Availability, never authority**: the relay retains the SAME E2EE Ed25519-signed ciphertext it routes; receivers verify + dedup-by-mid + CRDT-merge exactly as if a peer served it; peer sync stays the correctness floor. RAM-only by design (restart = clean slate; nothing seizable persists).

- **DM tier**: `set_offline_buffer {enabled, retention_secs}` (see offline_buffer bullet above). Dart default ON at 3d (`offlineInboxProvider`/`offlineInboxRetentionProvider`, re-applied from `_bootstrap`; ws_client re-registers on reconnect). Delete-on-replay unchanged.
- **Channel rings**: `topic_buffers: room+'\0'+topic -> TopicBuffer{frames(0x08 form + sender), bytes, retention, last_registered}`. Registered additively via `set_topic_buffer {room, channels[], retention_secs}` (member must be in room); idle-expire 7d. **`clear:true` is non-destructive since 2026-08** (issue #46): it sets `accepting=false` and drops `retention_secs` to `OFFLINE_RETENTION_MIN_SECS`, so retained frames age out on the normal sweep instead of being erased on demand, and a drained non-accepting ring is reaped immediately. It used to erase every buffer for the room outright — and since the relay authorizes `clear` by room membership alone (it cannot tell an owner from a member, by design), any single member could destroy the shared catch-up state everyone else depended on. Convention said "Owner/Admin toggle site only"; nothing enforced it. Re-registering re-arms `accepting`. Inbound `0x07` frames tee into registered rings (caps 200 msgs / 1MB per channel). `topic_catchup {room, channel, max_age_secs}` replays to the requester, skipping their own frames (MLS can't decrypt own ciphertext) and frames older than `max_age_secs` (client watermark + 30min lookback via `catchup_watermark_age_secs` — stops SecretReuse noise from cross-session re-replay). Deletion = retention expiry, NEVER delivery ("everyone got it" is unknowable without learning membership).
- **Client wiring** (swarm.rs): CRDT setting `relay_catchup_secs` (Owner/Admin `ServerSettingChanged`; ABSENT = default ON 259200s, explicit "0" = off). Per-channel `relay_catchup_done` gate (cleared on Disconnected); catch-up fires on RoomMembers sweep AND on `SubscribeChannels` (channel open). `register_relay_catchup` re-registers on toggle, connect, channel open, channel create.
- **MLS late-delivery windows** (mls_manager.rs `hollow_join_config`): `out_of_order_tolerance=512`, `maximum_forward_distance=2000`, `max_past_epochs=3`, applied at create/join AND upgraded onto loaded groups via `set_configuration` — OpenMLS defaults (5, 1000, 0) made replayed ring frames permanently undecryptable after newer traffic or an epoch bump.
- **Iron rule**: anything that must reach OFFLINE channel members rides `0x07` topic frames — 0x03 room broadcasts and targeted direct sends are invisible to the rings (channel FileHeaders + file companion messages were both moved to `send_mls_broadcast_topic`).
- **NOT covered**: public channels (0x03, no topic); file BYTES (metadata-only headers; bytes via request-on-open). **OPEN BUG**: channel files still don't render post-catch-up in the real client (harness guard green — see memory `project_relay_availability_cache`).
- **Pending server joins (rung 1, 2026-08-29) reuse this EXACT machinery with ZERO relay changes.** The client treats a server room's join queue as just another topic, `~join` (`JOIN_TOPIC` in `node/types.rs`), registered via the same `set_topic_buffer` call that registers text channels, teed into on `SendToRoomTopic` the same way, and read back via the same `topic_catchup`. This works because the relay validates topic strings for LENGTH only: it has no notion of "channel" versus anything else, so a client-invented topic name is indistinguishable from a real channel id to the C++ side. A parked join request, and a member's resolution of one, are just frames on a ring like any other.

### Channel push (0x09, 2026-06-10)

Server-channel messages reach offline members' phones via SENDER-targeted **0x09 frames** — the relay still never learns membership (the sender picks targets from its CRDT). Frame: `[0x09][room\0][target\0][channel\0][flags:1][payload]`, flags bit0 = mention, payload = the SAME MLS-group/public wire bytes the room broadcast carried (empty = push trigger only, Olm-legacy servers). `handle_binary_channel_direct`: sender must be in the room; buffers whenever the target is **NOT IN THE SERVER ROOM** (2026-07-04 fix — the old FULLY-offline full-return silently dropped copies during the auth→join race and the ~70s ghost-socket window after a hard quit) → `buffer_offline_msg(.., is_channel=true)` (third independent cap `MAX_BUFFERED_CHANNEL_MSGS_PER_PEER = 30`, replayed as 0x06 like everything else); push (`try_channel_push_notify`) only when fully offline.

`try_channel_push_notify` filters BEFORE contacting the sidecar (iOS alert pushes can't be suppressed after delivery):
1. **Prefs registry** `push_prefs: peer -> server -> ServerPushPref{level, channels{cid->level}}` — set via the `set_push_prefs` text message (RAM only, replaced wholesale, re-sent by the app on every reconnect; defensive caps 256 servers / 1024 channels). Channel override beats server level; unregistered = "all" (old clients keep working). Guests rejected; 0x09 also guest-blocked.
2. **Throttles** (state.h): non-mention `CHANNEL_PUSH_DEBOUNCE_SECS = 120` per (peer,server) + `CHANNEL_PUSH_MAX_WHILE_OFFLINE = 3` (counter in `channel_push_state`, reset when the full non-fetch app rejoins THAT server room in `handle_join`; deliberately NOT cleared on disconnect — that's the point of the cap); mention `CHANNEL_PUSH_MENTION_DEBOUNCE_SECS = 10`; `CHANNEL_PUSH_MIN_GAP_SECS = 5` per-peer floor across all servers (`last_channel_push_any`).

Sidecar payload gains `{server, channel, mention}` → FCM `data:{type:'channel_wake', sender, server, channel, mention:'1'/'0'}` (FCM data values must be strings); iOS `apns-collapse-id = iosCollapseId(server + ':' + channel)` so one banner per channel gets replaced by newer pushes. See `push_notifications.md` (Channel push section) + memory `project_channel_push_notifications.md`.

E2EE preserved — buffer holds ciphertext only (image bytes are AES-encrypted inside the Olm-encrypted FileHeader). Durable delivery still owned by full-node DM-sync; the buffer is latency glue so push previews are accurate. Client side: `rust/hollow_core/src/node/fetch.rs` + `lib/src/core/services/push_notification_service.dart`. See memory `project_push_notification_implementation.md`, `feedback_fcm_image_invisible_bubble.md`.

### Push sidecar payload (`push-sidecar/index.js`, VPS localhost:3001)

Node.js sidecar (Firebase Admin SDK) POST `/push` with `{token, platform, sender}`. Builds the FCM message: `data: {type:'wake', sender}` always (the `sender` peer_id rides here, opaque to Apple/Google). Then per platform:
- **Android:** `android.priority = 'high'`.
- **iOS:** a **VISIBLE ALERT** push — `apns-priority:10`, `apns-push-type:alert`, `aps.alert={title:'Hollow', body:'New message'}`, `sound:'default'`, `mutable-content:1`, `content-available:1`. NOT a pure silent (`content-available`-only) push: iOS throttles/drops silent background pushes by design (≈2–3/hr, "opportunities not guarantees"), so they were unreliable for a messenger. A priority-10 alert is delivered immediately and not throttled. The body is a GENERIC "New message" — zero metadata to Apple. `mutable-content:1` triggers the Notification Service Extension (below); `content-available:1` also wakes the Dart bg handler. (APNs rule: priority must be 5 for pure background, 10 for alert — can't combine priority-10 with a pure `content-available` push.)

### iOS rich notifications — Notification Service Extension (Tier A)

The NSE rewrites the generic banner into the sender's real **name + avatar**. It runs in a SEPARATE process/sandbox and CANNOT read the app's private encrypted DB, so:

- **App Group** `group.com.anonlisten.hollow` shared between Runner + the extension (entitlements on both; capability enabled on both App IDs in the Apple portal).
- **Push-hints cache** (`lib/src/core/services/push_hints_cache.dart`): the main app (unlocked, has the DB key) writes a small `{peerId: {name, avatar}}` map to `<AppGroupRoot>/push_hints/hints.json` plus per-friend `<peerId>.img` avatar PNGs. `PushHintsCache.scheduleWrite(friendIds)` is debounced (1.5s) and iOS-gated; hooked into `friendsProvider.loadAll()` (covers startup + every friend mutation) and `event_provider` `ProfileUpdated`. The App Group container path is resolved via the `hollow/app_group` MethodChannel in `AppDelegate.swift` (`getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` is the PRIVATE sandbox, NOT the group container).
- **Extension** (`ios/NotificationService/NotificationService.swift`): reads `userInfo["sender"]` → reads `hints.json` → sets `title` = name, `body` = "Sent you a message", attaches the avatar (copied to a tmp `.png` for `UNNotificationAttachment`). `serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire` delivers the best attempt; any miss (no App Group, missing/corrupt cache, unknown sender) falls through to the original generic banner — never drops a push.
- **CRITICAL — writer/reader path must match exactly:** both use `push_hints/hints.json` with NO `hollow/` prefix; a mismatch silently degrades to the generic banner (the NSE fails gracefully so it looks like "no hint"). See `feedback_app_group_path_match.md`.
- **Message TEXT/IMAGE preview in the banner = Tier B, deferred** — it needs decryption, which means migrating the iOS data dir into the App Group + a Rust C-ABI linked into the NSE. Tier A ships name+avatar only; body stays generic.

iOS build/config: classic non-UIScene AppDelegate + firebase pinned below the iOS-SDK-v12 break (`firebase_core ^3.15.2`, `firebase_messaging ^15.2.10`) keeps the iOS 13 floor. See memory `project_push_notification_implementation.md`, `feedback_ios_xcode26_toolchain.md`.

## Security properties

- **Zero-knowledge routing:** The relay never decrypts message content. All payloads are opaque bytes.
- **Authenticated connections:** Every WebSocket connection requires a valid Ed25519 signature over a timestamped challenge. No anonymous connections.
- **No metadata logging (source-enforced, 2026-06-23):** NO log statement in the relay prints a peer_id, room, push target/sender, channel, server, or push token. The entire `[push]` family (buffer/replay/send-push/token-register/prefs/channel-push/direct-not-in-room) and `[license] Key revoked for peer <id>` were stripped — the relay must not record who-talks-to-whom (a truncated `12D3KooW…` prefix still fingerprints). Only aggregate counts (`Swept N`, `Loaded N key(s)`), config-file paths in parse errors, and `[main]` startup/shutdown banners remain. peer_ids in `state.*` maps / protocol `send_json` responses / signature strings are routing logic, NOT logging. See `feedback_relay_no_metadata_logging.md`.
- **Sender identity injection:** For binary types 0x02/0x03/0x04, the relay replaces/injects the sender's peer_id — peers cannot spoof their identity to the relay.
- **Timestamp anti-replay:** 60-second skew window limits replay attacks on auth and signaling requests.
- **No rate limiting:** Removed — Ed25519 auth + license keys are the DoS protection layer.
- **Room isolation:** Peers can only send to rooms they've joined. Non-members are silently rejected.
- **License revocation:** Active connections can be terminated within 30 seconds by removing their key from `keys.json`.
