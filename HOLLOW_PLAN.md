## 1. Vision & Core Principles

### What Hollow Is

A communication platform where **every member collectively hosts the server they belong to**. There is no data center, no cloud subscription, no single point of failure. When you join a Hollow server, you donate a small amount of your disk space and bandwidth. In return, the server exists — distributed across everyone's devices — as long as at least one member is online.

### Core Principles

1. **Zero Central Infrastructure** — The server IS its members. No company to shut down, no hosting bill, no terms of service changes. A lightweight signaling service exists only for initial peer discovery (like DNS for the internet — tiny, stateless, replaceable).

2. **Native Performance** — Flutter compiles to native binaries. No Electron, no embedded Chromium, no Node.js runtime. A 50-80 MB installer that runs as fast as any native app.

3. **Dead-Simple Installation** — Download EXE/DMG/APK. Install. Open. Done. No `npm install`, no Docker, no command line, no GitHub clone instructions. Your grandma should be able to install it.

4. **End-to-End Encrypted Everything** — Messages, files, voice calls, video calls, screen shares. The infrastructure (relay nodes, storage chunks on other members' devices) sees only encrypted noise.

5. **Shared Storage, Shared Responsibility** — Every member donates disk space. The server's capacity grows with its community. Data is erasure-coded and distributed so no single member's departure causes data loss.

6. **Discord-Level UX** — Servers, channels, roles, permissions, threads, reactions, embeds, rich presence. Users shouldn't have to sacrifice features for privacy and decentralization.

**Data flow for sending a server channel message:**
1. User types message in Flutter UI
2. Message is signed with Ed25519 and wrapped in a `MessageEnvelope`
3. Envelope is MLS-encrypted (one encrypt operation for the entire server group)
4. Encrypted ciphertext is sent via `SendToRoom` to the WSS relay
5. Relay broadcasts to all room members (single WS send, relay fans out)
6. Each member decrypts via MLS, verifies signature, stores in SQLCipher
7. When offline members reconnect, they sync missing messages via MLS-encrypted channel probes

**Data flow for sending a DM:**
1. Message is signed and wrapped in a `MessageEnvelope`
2. Envelope is Olm-encrypted (Double Ratchet, per-session keys)
3. Sent to the peer via WS relay (direct message, not broadcast)
4. Peer decrypts via Olm, stores locally

## 3. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Client Framework** | Flutter (Dart) | Single codebase → native Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web. No Electron. |
| **Transport** | WebSocket Relay (WSS) via `tokio-tungstenite` | Single persistent WSS connection per client to relay server. Room-based broadcast for servers, direct messages for DMs. Binary frames for file/shard streaming. 30s keepalive ping. |
| **Relay Server** | Axum (Rust) — HTTP signaling + WebSocket room router | Deployed on VPS (relay.anonlisten.com:443 via Nginx TLS). Stateless encrypted pipe — sees only ciphertext. Room join/leave, message broadcast, binary forwarding, presence notifications. |
| **Data Sync** | Custom CRDTs (Rust) | Custom CRDT types: LWW-Register (roles, settings), OR-Set-like (channels, members), op-log with HLC ordering. State vectors for delta sync. No Automerge dependency. |
| **Distributed Storage** | Adaptive Reed-Solomon erasure coding + full replication | <6 members: full replication (P2P streaming). 6+: adaptive erasure coding — k/m scale with member count (1.5x overhead). Files/media only. Vault shards distributed via MLS metadata + WS binary streaming. |
| **E2EE (Servers)** | OpenMLS 0.8 (MLS RFC 9420) via Rust FFI | ALL server messages: MLS group encrypt → `SendToRoom` broadcast. One encrypt, relay fans out. Target filtering for peer-specific messages (all decrypt for ratchet sync, only target processes). Scales O(log n) on member changes. |
| **E2EE (DMs)** | vodozemac (Olm/Double Ratchet) via Rust FFI | 1:1 DMs: Olm encryption with Double Ratchet. Key exchange via `KeyRequest`/`KeyBundle` over WS (no DHT). Forward secrecy + post-compromise security. |
| **E2EE (Calls)** | DTLS-SRTP + SFrame | WebRTC native encryption + inner SFrame E2EE layer for all calls (1:1 and group). DM calls: random key in Olm-encrypted invite. Voice channels: MLS `export_secret("sframe")` epoch key, auto-rotates on membership change. Applied to voice, video, and screen share tracks. |
| **Voice/Video** | flutter_webrtc (forked 1.4.1) | 1:1 calls (direct P2P), small group mesh (2-5), gossip-tree forwarding (6+). No SFU — each peer forwards to ~6-12 neighbors. Scales to 1000+ with zero VPS bandwidth for media. TURN fallback for ~10-15% behind symmetric NAT. |
| **Screen Share** | flutter_webrtc `getDisplayMedia()` | Screen/window capture with quality picker (360p–4K, 5–60fps). Separate RTCPeerConnection per peer. SFrame E2EE. System audio capture via WASAPI loopback (Windows, forked flutter_webrtc). |
| **Local Database** | SQLite (encrypted via SQLCipher) | All local data encrypted at rest. Fast, embedded, no server needed. `rusqlite` with `bundled-sqlcipher` feature. |
| **Identity** | Ed25519 keypairs via `ed25519-dalek` v2.2 | Public key = identity. PeerId derived as `base58btc(multihash(identity(protobuf(pubkey))))`. BIP-39 mnemonic backup. No phone numbers, no email. |
| **P2P Data Transfer** | WebRTC data channels via flutter_webrtc | File/shard/Share chunk bytes flow over direct P2P connections (~9 MB/s). WSS relay fallback when WebRTC unavailable. ~85-90% of data transfer bandwidth is direct P2P. |

### Why Rust FFI Instead of Pure Dart

The networking, crypto, and storage layers require battle-tested implementations that don't exist in Dart. `flutter_rust_bridge` v2.11.1 provides ergonomic, type-safe FFI between Dart and Rust with async support:

- **Dart** handles UI, app logic, state management (Riverpod)
- **Rust** handles networking (WS client), crypto (Olm, MLS, AES), storage engine (SQLCipher, vault), CRDTs
- **FFI bridge** connects them with minimal overhead — event streaming via `StreamSink`

This is the same pattern used by major apps (e.g., Signal uses Rust for its crypto library across all platforms).

## 4. Distributed Storage System — "Shared Vault"

This is the core innovation. Every member donates storage. The server's files live distributed across everyone's devices. The vault is **always on** — the storage mode adapts automatically based on server size. Vault handles **files and media only** — text messages, CRDTs, and server config use the existing sync system.

### Design Decisions

- **Vault scope:** Files/media only. Text messages and CRDTs already have their own sync+storage system and are negligible in size. Vault is not needed for them.
- **DMs stay direct P2P.** No vault involvement — DMs are 1:1, erasure coding has no benefit. Full sync between the two peers as-is.
- **Automatic mode selection:** Below 6 members → full replication (every member gets every file). 6+ members → erasure coding with adaptive k/m. No admin toggle needed — "just works."
- **Manifests broadcast to all members** (like CRDT ops). Manifests are tiny (~200 bytes), full replication is simpler and more reliable than erasure coding them.
- **Forward-only retention (Rat Files safe):** Retention settings only apply to files uploaded AFTER the setting is changed. Existing files keep their original retention. This prevents malicious owners from retroactively deleting evidence. Default: 365 days for files, 90 days for voice. If owner sets `retention_files: 90d`, only new uploads get the 90-day expiry. All existing data is untouched.

### How It Works

#### 4.1 Storage Pledge

When joining a server, each member automatically pledges a minimum amount of storage (set by the server admin, default 512 MB). Members can optionally donate more.

```
Server: "Cozy Community"
Members: 100
Minimum pledge: 512 MB
Total raw pool: 50 GB (minimum) + voluntary donations
Usable capacity: ~33 GB (after erasure coding overhead)
```

#### 4.2 Adaptive Storage Modes

**Small servers (<6 members) — Full Replication:**
- Every file is synced to every member (same as current P2P file sharing, but managed by the vault storage/cache layer)
- Simple, reliable, fast — everyone has everything
- Storage overhead: Nx (where N = member count), but for 3-5 people with small files this is negligible
- Retention is forward-only (Rat Files philosophy): setting changes only affect new uploads, existing files stay permanent

**Larger servers (6+ members) — Erasure Coding (Reed-Solomon):**

Instead of storing N full copies of everything, use erasure coding:

- Split each file into **k** data shards
- Generate **m** parity shards (using Reed-Solomon coding)
- Total **n = k + m** shards
- Any **k** of the **n** shards can reconstruct the original file

**Adaptive k/m based on member count** — computed automatically:

| Members | k | m | n (total shards) | Tolerance | Overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| < 6 | — | — | — (full replication) | all but 1 | Nx |
| 6-8 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 offline | 1.67x |
| 9-15 | 5 | 3 | 8 | 3 offline | 1.60x |
| 16-30 | 8 | 4 | 12 | 4 offline | 1.50x |
| 31-60 | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 offline | 1.50x |
| 61-150 | 12 | 6 | 18 | 6 offline | 1.50x |
| 151-500 | 16 | 8 | 24 | 8 offline | 1.50x |
| 500+ | 20 | 10 | 30 | 10 offline | 1.50x |

Pattern: k scales with log(member_count), m = ceil(k/2), overhead converges to 1.5x. Total shards n never exceeds 30 — distributing 30 shards across thousands of members is trivial. Pure function: `compute_adaptive_params(member_count) -> (k, m)`.

When members join/leave and cross a threshold, **new content uses the new k/m**. Existing content stays at its original k/m — re-encoding everything would be prohibitively expensive. The rebalancer only repairs missing shards, not re-encodes.

Storage tier multiplier adjusts m relative to the base: standard tier uses base m, higher tiers increase m proportionally.

#### 4.3 Content-Addressed Storage

Every piece of data is addressed by its cryptographic hash (SHA-256):

```
content_id = SHA-256(encrypted_data)
```

This provides:
- **Deduplication** — identical content stored once
- **Integrity verification** — detect corrupt or tampered shards
- **Location-independent addressing** — find data by hash, not by "which server it's on"

#### 4.4 Deterministic Shard Placement (XOR Distance)

Shard placement is deterministic — all peers compute the same placements independently using XOR distance:

1. Compute `content_id = SHA-256(encrypted_data)`
2. For each shard `i`, compute `shard_key = SHA-256(content_id || i_as_u16_be)`
3. For each peer, compute `distance = XOR(shard_key, SHA-256(peer_id))` (256-bit keyspace)
4. Sort peers by distance (ascending), assign shard to closest peer with available capacity
5. Weighted by storage pledge: `per_peer_cap = ceil(n * peer_pledge / total_pledge)`

**Key property:** Any peer can recompute placements using the same algorithm (content_id + member list + pledges from CRDT). Non-uploaders can determine where shards live without needing a central directory.

To retrieve: recompute placements → request missing shards from their assigned peers via MLS → reconstruct from any k of k+m shards.

#### 4.5 Rebalancing

When a member leaves (or goes permanently offline):

1. Other members detect the departure (no heartbeat for configured threshold, e.g., 7 days)
2. The system identifies which shards are now under-replicated
3. Surviving members that have the remaining shards generate the missing parity shards
4. New shards are placed on other members with available capacity

When a new member joins:

1. Some shards are migrated to the new member to balance load
2. This happens gradually in the background, not all at once
3. Priority: move shards from members who are over-capacity

#### 4.6 Storage Tiers

Tiers apply only to files/media in the vault. k/m values below are base values for a 31-60 member server — actual values are computed adaptively from member count, then scaled by tier multiplier.

| Data Type | Tier Multiplier (on m) | Retention | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Images and files | 1.0x (standard) | Configurable (default: 1 year) | Standard |
| Voice message recordings | 0.6x (lower m) | Configurable (default: 90 days) | Low |

Note: Server config, roles, channel metadata, text messages, and CRDTs are **not vault-stored** — they use the existing CRDT sync system which already replicates to all connected members.

#### 4.7 Local Cache

Each member also maintains a local cache of recently accessed files (outside their pledge). This means:
- Files in channels you actively use are fast to load (local)
- Scrolling back loads files from the distributed network
- Going offline? You still have your recently viewed files locally
- Sender sees their uploaded file immediately from local cache while shards distribute in background

## 5. Networking Layer — WebSocket Relay

### 5.1 Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke via WSS Relay

Hollow uses a **WebSocket relay server** as the primary (and currently sole) transport. Every client maintains ONE persistent WSS connection to the relay. The relay is a stateless encrypted pipe — it routes messages between room members but cannot read any content (all payloads are MLS or Olm encrypted).

```
Client A ──WSS──► ┌─────────────────┐ ◄──WSS── Client B
                  │   WS Relay      │
                  │  (Axum/Rust)    │
                  │                 │
                  │  Room Router:   │
                  │  - Join/Leave   │
                  │  - Broadcast    │
                  │  - Direct msg   │
                  │  - Binary fwd   │
                  │  - Presence     │
Client C ──WSS──► │                 │ ◄──WSS── Client D
                  └─────────────────┘
```

**Why relay instead of direct P2P for signaling:**
- NAT traversal is unreliable (~80% success for hole punching, 0% behind symmetric NAT)
- Direct P2P connection churn caused sync failures, prekey storms, transport cycling
- Single WSS connection is simpler, faster to establish, works through any firewall
- TLS on port 443 looks like normal HTTPS traffic (harder to censor)
- Relay sees only encrypted ciphertext — zero trust compromise
- Heavy data (files, shards, voice, video) goes over WebRTC P2P connections established via relay signaling

### 5.2 Transport Details

**WSS Connection:**
- URL: `wss://relay.anonlisten.com/ws` (Nginx TLS termination on port 443)
- Authentication: Ed25519 signature (`hollow-ws-auth:{peer_id}:{timestamp}`)
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max)
- 30-second keepalive ping prevents idle connection drops
- Re-joins all rooms on reconnect

**Message types (JSON text frames):**
- `Auth` — authenticate with peer_id + signature
- `Join/Leave` — room membership
- `Msg` — broadcast to room (base64-encoded MLS ciphertext)
- `Direct` — send to specific peer in room

**Binary frames (for file/shard streaming):**
- `0x02` prefix — `BinaryDirect` frame: `[0x02][room\0][target\0][payload]`
- 256KB chunk size for large transfers
- Relay swaps target→sender in header before forwarding
- Used for AES-encrypted file bytes and vault shard data

### 5.3 Room-Based Routing

Each server has a room (room_code = server_id). Each DM pair has a room (room_code = sorted hash of both peer IDs). The relay tracks room membership and routes accordingly:

- **`SendToRoom`** — broadcast to all room members except sender. Used for MLS-encrypted server messages.
- **`SendDirect`** — send to one specific peer in a room. Used for Olm DMs and targeted shard requests.
- **`BinaryDirect`** — binary frame forwarded to one peer. Used for file/shard streaming.
- **Presence** — relay emits `PeerJoined`/`PeerLeft` events when members join/leave rooms.

### 5.4 Signaling Service

A lightweight HTTP signaling service runs alongside the WS relay on the same VPS. It provides initial peer discovery:

- Peers register their addresses for each room they belong to
- New peers bootstrap by querying the signaling service for known peers in a room
- Heartbeat: 120-second keepalive, 3-minute stale cleanup
- NOT used for message routing — only for initial connection bootstrapping
- Ed25519 signed requests prevent impersonation

### 5.5 Connection Lifecycle

1. App starts → WS client connects to relay → authenticates
2. Joins rooms for all known servers + DM friends
3. Relay emits `PeerJoined` for each room member already present
4. Peer discovery triggers CRDT sync + MLS key exchange
5. All messages flow through WS relay from this point
6. On disconnect → relay notifies room members via `PeerLeft`
7. Client auto-reconnects and re-joins all rooms

### 5.6 Legacy: libp2p (Removed)

libp2p 0.56 was the original networking stack (QUIC, TCP, mDNS, Kademlia DHT, relay circuit, hole punching). It was fully removed during Phase 6.75. All networking now uses WSS relay for signaling + WebRTC for P2P data/media. PeerId format is retained (base58-encoded identity multihash of the Ed25519 public key) for backward compatibility, but the underlying transport is entirely WSS + WebRTC.

---

## 6. Data Synchronization — CRDTs

### 6.1 Why CRDTs

In a P2P system with no central server, two members can perform actions simultaneously (send messages, create channels, change roles). Without a central authority to decide ordering, you need data structures that **mathematically guarantee convergence** — all members end up with the same state regardless of the order they receive updates.

**CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)** provide exactly this.

### 6.2 CRDT Types Used

| Data | CRDT Type | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Message history | RGA (Replicated Growable Array) | Ordered list that handles concurrent inserts. Each message gets a unique, sortable ID (Hybrid Logical Clock). |
| Channel list | OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) | Add/remove channels. Concurrent add + remove → add wins. |
| Members list | OR-Set | Add/remove members with conflict resolution. |
| Roles & permissions | LWW-Register (Last Writer Wins) per field | Permission changes resolve by timestamp. Admin actions have priority. |
| Reactions | PN-Counter per emoji per message | Increment/decrement counts that merge correctly. |
| Pins | OR-Set | Pinned messages set. |
| User profiles | LWW-Map | Per-field last-writer-wins for display name, avatar, status. |
| Server settings | LWW-Map with admin priority | Settings merge with admin writes always winning. |

### 6.3 Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)

For ordering messages, use Hybrid Logical Clocks instead of wall clocks:

```
HLC = (physical_time, logical_counter, peer_id)
```

- `physical_time` — system clock, synchronized loosely (NTP)
- `logical_counter` — increments when the physical clock hasn't advanced, ensuring unique timestamps
- `peer_id` — tiebreaker for identical timestamps

HLCs are monotonically increasing per peer and establish a causal ordering. Two messages from different peers with close timestamps are ordered deterministically, and all peers agree on the order.

### 6.4 Sync Protocol

When two peers connect (or reconnect after being offline):

1. **Exchange state vectors** — each peer sends a compact summary of what it has: `{peer_A: hlc_42, peer_B: hlc_37, ...}` (the latest HLC seen from each originating peer)
2. **Compute delta** — each peer determines what the other is missing
3. **Send missing operations** — only the operations the other peer hasn't seen
4. **Apply operations** — CRDT merge is commutative and idempotent, so order doesn't matter and duplicates are harmless

This is efficient — after initial sync, only new operations are exchanged. A member returning after a week offline receives only the operations that happened during that week, not the entire history.

### 6.5 Custom CRDT Implementation

Hollow uses custom CRDT types (not Automerge) implemented in Rust:

- **ServerState** — the root CRDT document per server, containing all sub-CRDTs
- **op_log** — append-only log of `CrdtOp` operations, each with HLC timestamp + author + payload
- **StateVector** — compact summary `{peer_id: latest_hlc}` for delta sync
- **AdminLwwReg<T>** — LWW-Register where admin/owner writes always win conflicts

**CRDT operations are broadcast via MLS** (for servers) or plaintext (during join bootstrap):
```rust
// Rust side — creating and broadcasting a CRDT op
let op = state.create_op(CrdtPayload::ChannelAdded { channel_id, name });
let _ = state.apply_op(&op);

// Broadcast via MLS (single encrypt → SendToRoom → relay fans out)
let envelope = MessageEnvelope::CrdtOp { sid: server_id, op_json };
send_mls_broadcast(mls, ws_cmd_tx, &server_id, &envelope, keypair);
```

**Sync protocol:**
1. On peer connect: exchange `StateVector` (latest HLC per author)
2. Compute delta: `compute_delta(our_op_log, their_state_vector) → Vec<CrdtOp>`
3. Send missing ops via MLS `SyncResp` envelope
4. Receiver merges: `merge_ops(state, incoming_ops)` — commutative, idempotent
5. Fan-out sync coordinator: distributes channel sync probes across available peers with 5-second dedup

## 7. End-to-End Encryption

**Layer 1** protects against network eavesdroppers.
**Layer 2** protects against device theft / storage compromise.
**Layer 3** protects against EVERYONE except intended recipients — including relay nodes, storage nodes, and compromised peers.

### 7.2 Direct Messages (1:1) — Olm (Double Ratchet)

Uses vodozemac (Matrix's audited Olm implementation) for the Double Ratchet:

**Key Exchange (via WS relay — no DHT):**
- When Peer A wants to message Peer B for the first time:
  1. A sends `KeyRequest` to B via WS relay (plaintext `HavenMessage`)
  2. B generates a one-time key, responds with `KeyBundle { identity_key, one_time_key }`
  3. A creates an outbound Olm session using B's keys
  4. First message is a "PreKey message" (type 0) — B creates an inbound session from it
  5. `SessionAck` handshake upgrades both sides to Normal (type 1) ratchet
- Key exchange is nearly instant (one WS round-trip vs seconds for DHT lookup)
- Works even if B is online but not yet in the same WS room (routed via any shared room or direct connection)

**Double Ratchet (ongoing messages):**
- Every message uses a unique encryption key
- Keys are derived via a ratchet: `new_key = KDF(previous_key, new_DH_exchange)`
- Forward secrecy: compromising current keys doesn't reveal past messages
- Post-compromise security: a new DH exchange heals the session after a compromise
- Message keys are deleted after use

### 7.3 Group Channels — MLS (Messaging Layer Security)

For group channels (the "server channels" feature), use MLS (RFC 9420) instead of Signal's Sender Keys:

**Why MLS over Sender Keys:**
- Sender Keys: When a member leaves, all remaining members must re-key — O(n) cost
- MLS: Uses a binary tree (ratchet tree) of DH keys. Member changes are O(log n)
- For a 1000-member channel, that's ~10 operations instead of 1000

**How MLS works:**
1. Each channel is an MLS "group" with a ratchet tree
2. Each member is a leaf in the tree
3. Internal nodes hold DH key pairs derived from their children
4. The root holds the group secret, from which message encryption keys are derived
5. When a member joins/leaves, only the path from their leaf to the root is updated
6. A "Commit" message broadcasts the tree update to all members
7. All members can derive the new group secret from the updated tree

**Key rotation on member removal:**
1. Admin issues a Remove proposal + Commit
2. The removed member's leaf is blanked in the tree
3. Fresh randomness is injected into the path to the root
4. New epoch begins — removed member cannot derive the new group secret
5. Cost: O(log n) — only the path from the removed leaf to the root changes

### 7.4 File Encryption

```
1. Generate random File Encryption Key (FEK) — AES-256-GCM
2. Encrypt file: ciphertext = AES-256-GCM(FEK, file_data)
3. Wrap FEK with channel's current MLS epoch key
4. Erasure-code the ciphertext and distribute shards
5. Store wrapped FEK in the message metadata (within the E2EE message)
```

Peers storing the file shards hold only encrypted data. They can't decrypt without the FEK, which is only available to channel members.

### 7.5 Voice/Video/Screen Share Encryption

- **1:1 DM calls:** Direct peer-to-peer WebRTC with DTLS-SRTP + SFrame E2EE. Random 32-byte SFrame key transmitted in the Olm-encrypted `CallInvite` message.

- **Server voice channels:** SFrame E2EE with MLS-derived keys. Key derivation: `MLS group.export_secret("sframe", context=[], key_length=32)`. Key rotates automatically on every MLS epoch change (member join/leave), providing forward secrecy for real-time media.

- **Topology:** No SFU or "super peer." Instead, gossip-tree forwarding:
  - **Small group (2-5):** Full mesh — everyone sends to everyone.
  - **Larger group (6+):** Each peer forwards received audio/video to their connected gossip neighbors (~6-12 peers), minus the source. Covers 1000+ participants in 2-3 hops (~150-300ms). Zero VPS bandwidth for media.
  - **Transition:** Automatic with hysteresis — gossip at 6+, back to mesh at 4.

- **Screen sharing:** Separate RTCPeerConnection per peer direction. SFrame E2EE applied to screen share video and system audio tracks. Quality picker (360p–4K, 5–60fps). System audio via WASAPI loopback on Windows (forked flutter_webrtc).

- **SFrame scope:** Applied to all media types — voice audio, video camera, screen share video, and screen share audio tracks.

### 7.6 Crypto Libraries (Actual Implementation)

**DM E2EE:** `vodozemac` v0.9 (Rust, via FFI) — Matrix's audited Olm implementation. Double Ratchet for DMs. Key exchange via `KeyRequest`/`KeyBundle` over WS relay (no DHT). Two identity systems coexist: Ed25519 (transport/signing) and vodozemac Curve25519 (Olm sessions).

**Server E2EE:** OpenMLS 0.8 (Rust, via FFI) — MLS (RFC 9420) group encryption for ALL server messages. Distributed coordinator model (`is_mls_coordinator()` — lowest online peer_id in MLS group). Batch member addition (2-second timer, dedup by peer_id). `send_mls_broadcast()` → one encrypt → `SendToRoom` → relay fans out. `send_mls_to_peer()` → targeted messages with `target` field (all decrypt for ratchet sync, only target processes). 232 tests passing.

**Voice/Video/Screen E2EE:** SFrame (AES-128-GCM via flutter_webrtc `FrameCryptor` + `KeyProvider`). DM calls: random 32-byte key in Olm-encrypted `CallInvite`. Server voice channels: MLS `export_secret("sframe")` epoch key, auto-rotates on membership change. Applied to all media tracks (voice, video, screen share, system audio).

**File encryption:** AES-256-GCM (via `aes-gcm` crate) — per-file random key. Key transmitted in MLS-encrypted `FileHeader` envelope. File bytes streamed via WebRTC data channels (P2P) with WSS relay fallback.

**Local storage encryption:** SQLCipher (AES-256-CBC) — via `rusqlite` with `bundled-sqlcipher` feature.

**Identity:** `ed25519-dalek` v2.2 (direct dependency) — Ed25519 keypair generation, message signing, peer ID derivation. BIP-39 mnemonic for backup/restore.

**Flutter Web (future):** Web Crypto API via `webcrypto` package + WASM-compiled crypto primitives.

---

## 8. Identity & Authentication

### 8.1 Public Key as Identity

No phone numbers. No email addresses. No usernames registered on a central server.

```
Identity = Ed25519 public key
Display: Base58-encoded short form (e.g., "hVn8xR...3kQp")
Human-readable: Self-chosen display name (not unique, signed by identity key)
```

**Account creation:**
1. App generates Ed25519 keypair + X25519 keypair (or derives both from a single seed)
2. User chooses a display name
3. App prompts user to set up at least one recovery method (see 8.4)
4. That's it. No server registration, no verification, no waiting.

### 8.2 Multi-Device Sync (Device Linking)

Adding a new device is done directly from an existing device — no server involved.

**Linking flow:**
1. Open Hollow on the existing device (e.g., PC)
2. Go to Settings → Link New Device
3. PC displays a QR code containing:
   - A one-time session token
   - A temporary X25519 public key for establishing an encrypted channel
   - The PC's local network address (for LAN transfer) + peer ID
4. New device (e.g., phone) scans the QR code
5. Devices establish a direct encrypted channel (using the ephemeral key from the QR)
6. PC transfers to the phone:
   - Identity keypair (encrypted with the session token)
   - Server membership list + channel keys
   - Recovery guardian configuration
   - Account settings and contacts
7. Phone is now a fully linked device with the same identity

**Ongoing sync between linked devices:**
- Both devices share the same identity key → peers route messages to the identity, not a specific device
- When both devices are online, they sync directly via P2P (CRDT merge, same as server sync)
- When only one device is online, it collects everything — the other catches up later
- Critical account metadata (server list, roles, contacts) is stored at the **highest redundancy tier** in the Shared Vault, so the network remembers the user even if all their devices are offline

### 8.3 Account Recovery — Layered Approach

No single recovery method. Multiple options, layered by convenience and security. Users are encouraged to set up at least two.

#### Method 1: Device Linking (Primary — Most Common)

As described in 8.2. User has an existing device → scans QR → new device is set up in seconds. This handles the vast majority of cases (new phone, new computer, reinstalling the app).

#### Method 2: Social Recovery via Guardians (For Total Device Loss)

Inspired by Argent wallet's social recovery. Perfect for a community chat app — your backup IS your community.

**Setup:**
1. User designates 3-5 trusted contacts as **Recovery Guardians**
2. The identity key is split into shares using **Shamir's Secret Sharing** (k-of-n threshold scheme)
3. Each guardian receives one encrypted share via their pairwise E2EE channel
4. Guardians store the share automatically — no action needed from them
5. The threshold is configurable (e.g., 3-of-5, 2-of-3)

**Recovery flow:**
1. User loses ALL devices
2. Installs Hollow fresh on a new device
3. Enters their Hollow display name or public key fingerprint (short string they might remember, or have written down, or a friend can tell them)
4. App locates the guardians via DHT
5. User contacts guardians through any out-of-band channel ("Hey, I lost my phone, can you approve my recovery in Hollow?")
6. Each guardian receives a recovery request in-app and approves it
7. Once threshold is met (e.g., 3 of 5 approve), shares are sent to the new device via E2EE
8. Shares are recombined → identity key restored
9. Account data syncs from the Shared Vault (server memberships, channel keys via MLS re-welcome)

**Why this works for Hollow:** It's a social platform. Users inherently have trusted contacts. The "backup" is your friends — not a piece of paper in a drawer.

#### Method 3: Encrypted Vault Backup (For Solo Recovery)

For users who want self-reliant recovery without depending on others.

**Setup:**
1. User chooses a strong **recovery password** (or PIN + biometric on mobile)
2. Identity key + account data is encrypted with a key derived from the password (Argon2id KDF, high memory cost)
3. The encrypted backup blob is stored as a special shard in the Shared Vault, tagged to the user's public key
4. Redundancy: highest tier (same as server config — survives up to 50% of members going offline)

**Recovery flow:**
1. Install Hollow on new device
2. Enter Hollow ID (public key fingerprint — a short string like "hVn8-xR3k-Qp7z")
3. Network locates the encrypted backup shards, reconstructs the blob
4. Enter recovery password → decrypt → identity restored

**Brute-force protection:**
- Argon2id with high memory/time cost makes offline brute-force extremely slow
- Peers serving the backup shard enforce rate-limiting on retrieval requests (max 5 attempts per hour per IP)
- After 20 failed attempts, the backup is locked for 24 hours

#### Method 4: 24-Word Mnemonic (Optional — Power Users)

The traditional crypto-wallet approach. Available as an opt-in advanced feature in Settings → Security → Export Recovery Phrase.

- Deterministically regenerates the identity keypair from the mnemonic (BIP-39)
- For technically savvy users who want a completely self-sovereign backup
- Hollow does NOT show this by default during onboarding — it's buried in settings for those who want it

#### Recovery Method Comparison

| Method | User effort | Requires existing device | Requires other people | Requires remembering something |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Device Linking** | Scan QR code | Yes | No | No |
| **Social Recovery** | Ask 3 friends | No | Yes (guardians) | Hollow ID (short string) |
| **Vault Backup** | Enter password | No | No | Hollow ID + password |
| **24-Word Phrase** | Enter 24 words | No | No | 24 words (hard) |

### 8.5 Invite Links (No Central Server)

Invite links are cryptographically signed tokens, not URLs pointing to a server:

```
hollow://join?token=<base64-encoded signed blob>
```

The token contains:
- Server public key (identifies which server)
- Inviter's identity key + signature (proves who invited)
- Bootstrap peer list (2-3 IP:port of currently online members)
- DHT rendezvous key (hash of server key, for finding peers via DHT)
- Optional: expiry time, max uses, required role

**Flow:**
1. Inviter generates token, signs it with their identity key
2. Token is shared via any channel (copy-paste, QR code, email, another chat)
3. Joiner's app decodes token, verifies signature
4. App connects to bootstrap peers (or queries DHT with rendezvous key)
5. App authenticates with the server's member list (existing members verify the invite)
6. New member is added to the CRDT member list, receives the MLS welcome message
7. Member's device begins receiving and storing data shards

### 8.6 Server Roles & Permissions

Modeled after Discord but enforced via CRDTs with admin priority:

```
Role hierarchy (highest to lowest):
├── Owner (creator of the server, or transferred)
├── Admin (can manage roles, channels, members)
├── Moderator (can kick, mute, manage messages)
├── Custom roles (configured per server)
└── Member (default)
```

Permission changes are LWW-Register CRDTs with a twist: writes from higher-ranked roles always override lower-ranked roles in conflicts. The Owner's writes always win.

## 9. Real-Time Communication (Voice/Video/Screen Share)

### 9.1 Voice & Video Calls

**Technology:** flutter_webrtc 1.4.1 (forked, with WASAPI loopback for Windows screen share audio)

**Topologies:**
- **1:1 DM calls:** Direct P2P connection via WebRTC. DTLS-SRTP + SFrame E2EE (random key in Olm-encrypted `CallInvite`). Lowest latency.
- **Small group voice channels (2-5):** Full mesh — each participant sends audio/video to all others. Glare prevention: lower peer_id creates the offer.
- **Larger voice channels (6+):** Gossip-tree forwarding — each peer forwards received audio/video to their connected gossip neighbors (~6-12 peers), minus the source. No SFU, no "super peer." Covers 1000+ participants in 2-3 hops (~150-300ms latency). Each peer handles ~6 connections regardless of total participants. Zero VPS bandwidth for media.
- **Topology transition:** Automatic with hysteresis — mesh below 6 participants, gossip at 6+, back to mesh at 4 (prevents thrashing).

**SFrame E2EE for voice channels:**
- Key derived from MLS epoch: `export_secret("sframe", context=[], key_length=32)`
- Key rotates on every membership change (MLS epoch advance)
- Applied to all audio, video, and screen share tracks via `FrameCryptor` + `KeyProvider`

**TURN fallback:**
- Self-hosted coturn on VPS (UDP :3478, TCP :3478, TLS :5349)
- HMAC-SHA1 credentials with 1-hour TTL, auto-refreshed every 50 minutes
- ~10-15% of users need TURN (symmetric NAT). TURN sees only SFrame ciphertext.

### 9.2 Screen Sharing

Supported via flutter_webrtc `getDisplayMedia()`:

| Platform | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | DXGI Desktop Duplication / Windows.Graphics.Capture | Full screen or specific window. System audio via WASAPI loopback (forked flutter_webrtc) |
| macOS | ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 12.3+) | Full screen or specific window. System audio capture deferred (no test hardware) |
| Linux | PipeWire (Wayland) / X11 capture | Varies by DE/display server. System audio deferred |
| Android | MediaProjection API | Requires foreground service + permission |
| iOS | ReplayKit (Broadcast Upload Extension) | Separate target, 50 MB memory limit |

**Implementation details:**
- Separate RTCPeerConnection per peer per direction (not reusing the voice PC — different lifecycle)
- Quality/FPS picker: 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p (default), 1440p, 4K. FPS: 5, 15, 30, 60 (default)
- SFrame E2EE on both video and audio tracks of the screen share
- Both-sharing handled (stacked view: remote top, local banner bottom)
- Late joiner support: sharer sends screen_state + screen_offer on remote peer join
- Full-bleed layout with overlay chat + floating controls pill (auto-fade 1s)

### 9.3 Audio Processing

- Echo cancellation, noise suppression, automatic gain control — handled by WebRTC's built-in audio processing
- Voice activity detection (VAD) — local via amplitude monitoring, remote via `getStats` audio energy delta. Teal dot indicator on participant rows
- Per-peer volume control (0-200%) via right-click popup on participant rows
- Audio quality presets: Voice (32 kbps mono), Music (128 kbps stereo), Hi-Fi (256 kbps stereo) — SDP munging on Opus fmtp line
- Device selection: mic via `sourceId` constraint, speaker via `win32audio`. Persisted in SQLCipher

---

## 10. Discord Import System

### 10.1 Data Sources

Discord provides data exports via GDPR request (Settings → Privacy → Request all of my Data). This produces a ZIP containing:

- `messages/` — JSON files for every DM and channel, including content, timestamps, authors, attachments (as URLs)
- `servers/` — Server metadata, channel lists, roles
- `account/` — User profile info

### 10.2 Import Flow

```
Step 1: User requests Discord data export (takes 24-48h from Discord)
Step 2: User provides the ZIP to Hollow's import tool
Step 3: Hollow parses the export:
        - Maps Discord servers → Hollow servers
        - Maps channels → channels (preserves names, descriptions, order)
        - Maps roles → roles (preserves hierarchy, permissions, colors)
        - Maps messages → messages (preserves content, timestamps, author IDs)
        - Downloads attachment URLs → stores as Hollow files
Step 4: Hollow creates the server structure
Step 5: Hollow generates invite links for each mapped Discord user
Step 6: Invited users join, confirm their identity, and gain their mapped roles
Step 7: Message history is attributed to "Discord Import: Username" until
        the user claims their account
```

### 10.3 Member Matching

- Import creates placeholder identities for each Discord user
- When a real user joins and claims a Discord username, their messages are re-attributed
- Claiming requires: joining via the correct invite link + providing their Discord user ID (from their own data export) as proof

## 11. Desktop & Mobile Distribution

### 11.1 Package Targets

| Platform | Format | Auto-Update | Distribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | MSIX (Store) + EXE (Inno Setup, direct) | MSIX: automatic. EXE: Squirrel.Windows or WinSparkle | Microsoft Store + direct download |
| **macOS** | DMG + notarized | Sparkle 2 (EdDSA signed appcast) | Direct download (App Store optional) |
| **Linux** | AppImage + Flatpak + Snap + deb/rpm | AppImage: AppImageUpdate. Snap/Flatpak: built-in. | Flathub + Snap Store + direct |
| **Android** | APK + AAB | Play Store: automatic. APK: in-app update check | Google Play + direct APK |
| **iOS** | IPA | App Store: automatic | App Store only |
| **Web** | Static PWA | Service worker cache | Any static host |

### 11.2 Binary Size Target

- Desktop: 50-80 MB installer (Flutter + Rust libs + crypto + bundled ffmpeg)
- Mobile: 30-50 MB (ARM optimized)
- Compare: Discord Electron is ~300 MB on desktop

### 11.3 Auto-Update Strategy

Host a JSON manifest at a well-known URL (and in the DHT for redundancy):

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "release_date": "2026-06-15",
  "channels": {
    "stable": {
      "windows": {"url": "...", "sha256": "..."},
      "macos": {"url": "...", "sha256": "..."},
      "linux": {"url": "...", "sha256": "..."}
    },
    "beta": { ... }
  },
  "release_notes": "..."
}
```

App checks on launch (or periodically). Downloads delta update if available, full installer otherwise. User prompted before applying.

## 12. UI/UX Design Approach

### 12.1 Design Philosophy

Built entirely with Flutter widgets. No web embedding, no WebView. The UI should feel native to each platform while maintaining a consistent Hollow identity.

**Design language:**
- Clean, modern, slightly rounded aesthetic (inspired by Discord's readability but with its own identity)
- Dark mode default with light mode option
- Adaptive layout: sidebar navigation on desktop, bottom navigation on mobile
- Smooth 60fps animations throughout

### 12.3 Adaptive Scaling

Use a system similar to `AdaptiveScaleProvider` from WholesomeStoryADay — normalize UI dimensions based on physical screen size and pixel density. This ensures the UI looks correct on:
- 13" laptop (1080p)
- 27" monitor (4K)
- 6" phone (1080p)
- 10" tablet (2K)

---

- [X] Room state cleanup (clear peers on room switch, deduplicate peer list)

**Deliverable:** Two users on different networks can find each other via invite link and chat with E2EE.

### Phase 2.5: UI Foundation

**Goal:** Establish Hollow's visual identity and UI architecture before building complex features on top. Replace Material Design defaults with a custom design system that feels native, premium, and distinctly Hollow.

**Design Direction:** Deep Dark + Teal Accent. Secure yet cozy — midnight backgrounds convey seriousness/trust, teal accent (#00BFA6) evokes calm/shelter (aligns with "Hollow" name). Distinct from Discord (purple), Signal (blue), WhatsApp (green). Multi-theme architecture from day one: default dark theme ships first, Frutiger Aero-inspired theme as a built-in alternate (glossy surfaces, vibrant gradients, bubble animations — leveraging Flutter's BackdropFilter, ShaderMask, CustomPainter).

**Color Palette (Default Dark Theme):**
- Background: #0D0F14 (deep midnight)
- Surface: #14161C (panels, slightly lighter)
- Elevated: #1A1D25 (cards, dialogs, popovers)
- Accent: #00BFA6 (teal — buttons, links, active states)
- Accent Hover: #00D9BB (lighter teal)
- Accent Muted: #00BFA633 (teal with alpha — subtle highlights)
- Text Primary: #F1F3F5 (near-white)
- Text Secondary: #8B919A (muted grey)
- Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.08) (subtle, 1px)
- Error/Danger: #EF4444
- Success: #10B981
- Warning: #F59E0B
- Border radius: 8-12px (medium rounded)

- [X] Custom theme system (HollowTheme: color palette, typography scale, spacing, elevation, border radii — no Material defaults. Multi-theme architecture supporting Default Dark + future Aero theme)
- [X] Dark mode primary, light mode secondary (both fully custom, not Material's ColorScheme)
- [X] Custom window chrome (remove native title bar, custom-drawn title bar with Hollow branding, window controls — via flutter_acrylic or bitsdojo_window)
- [X] State management architecture (Riverpod — chosen for auto-dispose, .family per-peer state, StreamProvider for Rust FFI streams, granular rebuilds)
- [X] Event streaming refactor (replace polling with Rust→Dart stream — real-time updates)
- [X] Navigation shell (server list sidebar, channel/chat view, member panel — responsive: sidebar on desktop, bottom nav on mobile)
- [X] Reusable component library (HollowButton, HollowTextField, HollowCard, HollowAvatar, HollowDialog, HollowToast — all custom-painted, no Material widgets)
- [X] Animation system (spring curves, page transitions, micro-interactions — buttery smooth 60fps, GPU-accelerated via Flutter's rendering pipeline)
- [X] Chat UI rebuild (message bubbles, timestamps, read indicators, typing indicator — custom widgets, not Material ListTiles)
- [X] Peer/contact list rebuild (online/offline status, avatars, encryption badge — integrated with new component library)
- [X] Adaptive layout system (responsive breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile — single codebase, three layouts)
- [X] Custom iconography (Hollow icon set or curated icon package — consistent visual language)

**Deliverable:** The app looks and feels like a real product — custom visual identity, smooth animations, responsive layout. All future UI work builds on this foundation.

### Phase 2.75: Hollow Design System v2 — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Replace all Material Design defaults with Hollow's own interaction system. Zero Material interaction widgets remain. Spring physics, no ripple, custom everything.

- [X] HollowPressable — universal interaction widget (press: opacity 0.85 + scale 0.98, spring physics)
- [X] HollowButton — 4 variants: filled, ghost, outline, danger (self-contained animations, hover glow)
- [X] HollowTextField — flat design, animated border color, focus glow, error shake
- [X] HollowDialog — showHollowDialog() with glassmorphism (BackdropFilter 12px blur, scale entrance)
- [X] HollowTooltip — overlay-based, 400ms delay, fade+slide entrance
- [X] HollowToggle — spring physics thumb, color crossfade track
- [X] HollowToast — slide-up + fade, 3 types (success/error/info), auto-dismiss, replaces SnackBar
- [X] HollowAvatar v2 — gradient background, status dot integration
- [X] StatusDot v2 — breathing pulse glow (3s cycle, BoxShadow)
- [X] PeerCard / ChannelTile — HollowPressable with smooth selection transitions
- [X] ServerStrip icons — HollowPressable, scale-bounce for new icons, selection indicator
- [X] Dialog migration — all 4 dialogs (CreateServer, CreateChannel, Invite, Mnemonic)
- [X] Global cleanup — zero InkWell, IconButton, SnackBar, Tooltip, AlertDialog, FilledButton, TextButton, OutlinedButton remaining
- [X] UI Polish Pass — glassmorphism, startup reveal (2500ms), ambient background, shader warmup, GPU-composited transitions

**Deliverable:** Every interactive element uses custom Hollow widgets. The app feels premium and distinctly Hollow.

### Phase 3: Servers & Channels

**Goal:** Multi-user servers with channels, roles, and MLS encryption.

- [X] Ghost peer fix
- [X] 10s disconnection delay fix
- [X] CRDT integration (`crdts` crate + custom AdminLwwReg) for server state — foundation for all distributed data
- [X] Hybrid Logical Clocks for message ordering
- [X] Sync protocol (state vectors, delta sync)
- [X] Server creation and management — uses CRDTs for distributed state. 🎞️ Animate: server icon appears in ServerStrip with scale-bounce, creation dialog entrance/exit
- [X] Channel system (text channels, categories) — uses CRDTs for channel list. 🎞️ Animate: channel switch crossfade in ChatPane, channel list reorder/add/remove with slide transitions
- [X] Channel messaging — Olm E2EE fan-out per member, JSON envelope (`{"t":"ch","sid":"...","cid":"...","text":"..."}`), separate `channel_messages` SQLCipher table, ChannelChatPane + ChannelMessageBubble UI
- [X] Server settings UI — full tabbed panel (Overview, Channels, Members, Danger Zone), rename server/channels, delete server/channels, server description, replaces chat pane
- [X] Server invite join flow — invite link adds joiner to CRDT member list, joiner receives server state + channel history, bootstrap peer list in invite token
- [X] Server/channel deletion broadcast — deleting a server or channel propagates to all connected members in real-time
- [X] Message deduplication — sender timestamp in envelope, UNIQUE DB constraint, Rust-side dedup before emitting events
- [X] Room gating — reject incoming CRDT state/ops for servers we hollow't explicitly joined, prevent auto-sync of unknown servers to non-members
- [X] Channel/server operation broadcast — channel creation, rename, and all CRDT mutations broadcast reliably to all server members (currently some operations only apply locally)
- [X] Message history sync on reconnection — pull-based catch-up: on peer reconnect, request missed channel messages since last-seen timestamp, peers respond from local DB. Prerequisite for reliable distributed messaging
- [X] Member presence (online/offline status)
  - Cross-reference `connected_peers` with server membership, emit presence events to UI
  - ASOT-style dividers: "Online ------------ 10" / "Offline -------- 5" with accent glow on Online only
  - Per-member sync icon: 12px spinning `refreshCw` on avatar bottom-right (Discord status dot position), replaces green/grey dot when syncing
  - Offline members: 0.5 opacity on whole row
  - Sync progress bar: `total_count` in ChannelSyncBatch envelope, "Syncing 47/120 messages..."
  - User bar: mirror channel pane status (Connecting.../Online), remove warning icon
  - DM peer list: spinning icon when peer discovered but Olm session not yet established (instead of no icon)
  - Remove duplicate connection info from member panel bottom (already in user bar)
  - Animate: member join/leave fade+slide, online->offline transitions, presence dot pulse
- [X] Roles and permissions system — uses CRDTs (LWW-Register with admin priority), UI for role assignment in server settings
- [X] Per-message signing
- [X] MLS group encryption for channels — standalone crypto task, can parallel with UI work
- [X] Offline message queuing (store-and-forward via online peers)
  - Peer B holds messages for offline peer A, delivers on reconnect. Builds on message history sync.
  - MESSAGE ORDERING DECISION: Don't insert by sender timestamp (abusable — clock manipulation, spam injection). Instead: append offline messages at bottom with visual separator ("3 messages from Peer B while offline"). Sender timestamp = display metadata only ("sent at 10:12"), not sort position. Receive order = authoritative sequence for live messages.
  - Animate: queued message shimmer/pending state, delivery confirmation tick

**Deliverable:** A functional group chat platform with servers, channels, roles, MLS encryption, and message sync.

### Phase 3.5: Daily Driver — Chat Features & Identity

**Goal:** Everything that makes Hollow a usable daily chat app. Core features that turn a working prototype into something people want to use every day.

**Identity & Profiles:**
- [X] User profiles (avatar, status message, about me). Display name (global, user-changeable) already exists — acts as the nickname. Peer ID shown under display name as the immutable identity tag. Avatar stored locally for now, synced to peers' encrypted DBs once basic file sharing is built. 🎞️ Animate: profile card pop-up with scale+fade, status change transitions
- [X] Server nicknames — per-server display name override via CRDT LWW-Register per member. Falls back to global display name when unset
- [X] Profile card popup on member click — shows avatar, display name, server nickname, role, peer ID snippet, status. 🎞️ Animate: scale+fade entrance from click origin

**Chat Essentials:**
- [X] Chat Redesign — flat stacked layout.
- [X] Message editing — CRDT op (EditMessage with original message ID + new text), broadcast to server members, update in local DB + UI. Edited messages show "(edited)" indicator. 🎞️ Animate: edit highlight flash
- [X] Multi-Peer Fan-out Sync — SyncCoordinator collects connected peers for 500ms, assigns channels round-robin across all available peers (primary + backup), sends lightweight ChannelSyncProbe (timestamp comparison) before full sync. Channels with no new messages are skipped entirely. Equal load distribution: the more peers online, the lighter the load per peer. On-demand RequestChannelSync (user opens channel) still fans out to all peers for immediacy
- [X] Message deletion — Channel: soft-delete (deleted_at timestamp, row stays in DB for Rat Files evidence preservation). DM: hard delete from local DB only (other peer keeps their copy). UI shows "Message deleted" placeholder. 🎞️ Animate: delete shrink+fade-out
- [X] Reply chains — reference parent message ID in envelope, render with quoted preview above reply. Clicking quote scrolls to original. 🎞️ Animate: reply chain indent slide
- [X] Emoji reactions — PN-Counter CRDT per emoji per message, broadcast to server members. 🎞️ Animate: reaction pop-in with spring bounce, count increment/decrement
- [X] Typing indicators — lightweight ephemeral signal (no persistence, no encryption needed). Broadcast to channel members, auto-expire after 5s. 🎞️ Animate: classic bouncing dots, smooth fade in/out
- [X] Rich text / markdown rendering in messages (bold, italic, code, code blocks, links). Link previews deferred to Phase 6
- [X] Pinned messages — CRDT OR-Set of pinned message IDs per channel, pin/unpin broadcast
- [X] Folder/Category system for channels

**Quality of Life:**
- [X] System Tray — App working in the background)
- [X] Friends system & DM overhaul — Rust: `friends` SQLCipher table (peer_id, display_name, added_at, status). Friend request flow: `FriendRequest` → `FriendAccepted`/`FriendDeclined` wire messages over Olm. Friends list persists offline (not just "who's online"). DM sidebar shows all friends (online/offline) with status dots, sorted online-first. DM history persists and loads from DB regardless of connection status. Unfriend removes from list but keeps DM history. No mutual server required — friends are independent of servers.
- [X] Friends plus other UI improvements
- [X] Notifications — system-level (Windows toast / macOS notification center), configurable per server and per channel (all / mentions only / none)
- [X] Search — local full-text search over decrypted messages in SQLCipher. 🎞️ Animate: search bar expand, results list staggered fade-in
- [X] Keyboard shortcuts (navigate channels, servers, quick-switch, mark as read)
- [X] Only one process instead of two apps being opened at the same time
- [X] Basic file sharing — direct P2P transfer via libp2p, encrypt with MLS/Olm before sending, store locally on receiver. Image/file preview in chat. No erasure coding yet (that's Phase 4). All images auto-converted to lossless WebP on send (25-35% smaller than PNG/JPEG, Flutter decodes natively, Rust `image` crate encodes). "Save as" option converts to user's chosen format (PNG/JPEG/WebP). 🎞️ Animate: upload progress, image shimmer placeholder → fade-in
- [X] Click reply context to scroll to original message

**Deliverable:** Hollow feels like a complete, polished chat app. Ready for daily use with friends.

### Phase 3.75: Security Hardening

**Goal:** Close all known security vulnerabilities before building the distributed storage layer. Every wire message from a peer is untrusted input — a malicious peer with basic programming knowledge can craft raw JSON messages to exploit any unvalidated handler. Fix all findings from the security audit (Mar 16, 2026).

**CRITICAL — privilege escalation & server destruction:**
- [X] **ServerDeleteBroadcast permission check** — currently ANY connected peer can send `ServerDeleteBroadcast { server_id }` and the receiver deletes the server immediately with zero verification. Fix: verify sender is the server Owner before processing. Reject and log all unauthorized attempts.
- [X] **MemberKickBroadcast permission check** — same issue: any peer can force you to leave any server. Fix: verify sender has `KICK_MEMBERS` permission and outranks the local user in the role hierarchy before processing.
- [X] **CRDT operation author verification** — `CrdtOpBroadcast` handler applies incoming ops with no permission checking. The `author` field in `CrdtOp` is self-reported and never verified against the actual sender's peer ID. A regular member can forge `RoleChanged { peer_id: self, role: Owner }` with the real owner's peer ID as author. Fix: (1) verify `op.author == actual_sender_peer_id`, (2) check that the author has permission for the specific operation type (e.g., only admins+ can `RoleChanged`, only owner can `MemberRemoved` for admins), (3) reject and log unauthorized ops.

**HIGH — resource exhaustion & validation:**
- [X] **Message size limit on HollowCodec** — `read_to_end` has no size cap. A peer can send a multi-GB message to cause OOM. Fix: use `io.take(MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE)` before `read_to_end` (e.g., 50MB max).
- [X] **Per-peer rate limiting** — no rate limits on any incoming message type. A peer can flood CRDT ops, messages, reactions, sync requests, file chunks. Fix: token-bucket rate limiter per peer (e.g., 100 messages/sec burst, 20/sec sustained). Excess messages dropped with log warning.
- [X] **Op log compaction** — `op_log: Vec<CrdtOp>` in ServerState grows without bound, serialized to JSON on every persist. Fix: implement periodic compaction — snapshot current state, prune ops older than the snapshot. Keep last N ops (e.g., 1000) for recent sync, discard the rest.
- [X] **Incoming FileHeader size validation** — receiver trusts declared `size` and `chunks` without checking server's max file size setting. Fix: validate `FileHeader.size <= max_file_size_mb` from ServerState settings before accepting. Reject oversized headers.

**MEDIUM — message integrity & access control:**
- [X] **Message deletion ownership check** — `DeleteMessage` handler doesn't verify the sender owns the message (unlike `EditMessage` which does). Any peer can hide any message. Fix: add same ownership check as edit handler (`get_channel_message_sender` / `get_dm_message_is_mine`).
- [X] **Enforce signature verification** — signature verification failures are logged but messages are still processed and stored. Fix: reject messages with invalid signatures. Accept unsigned messages for backward compatibility but mark them as `unverified` in the DB (new column). UI can optionally show unverified indicator.
- [X] **Cross-server channel message validation** — channel messages via Olm are not checked for server membership. A peer with an Olm session can inject messages into any server/channel on the victim. Fix: before storing a channel message, verify (1) server `sid` exists, (2) sender is a member of that server, (3) channel `cid` exists in the server.
- [X] **HLC drift bound** — `witness()` accepts any remote timestamp without bounding clock drift. A peer can send far-future timestamps to permanently win all LWW conflicts. Fix: reject timestamps more than 5 minutes ahead of local wall clock in `witness()`.
- [X] **File path sanitization** — `file_id` and `ext` from remote peers used directly in path construction (`files_dir/{file_id}.{ext}`). Path separators in these fields could write outside intended directory. Fix: sanitize both to alphanumeric + dots only: `chars().filter(|c| c.is_ascii_alphanumeric() || *c == '.').collect()`.
- [X] **Reaction removal ownership check** — `RemoveReaction` handler doesn't verify the sender originally added the reaction. Fix: verify `peer_id` matches sender before removing.

**LOW — defense in depth:**
- [X] **Chat message character limit** — no character limit on message text. A custom client could send a 100MB text message. Fix: enforce 4,000 character limit in both Dart (UI input maxLength) AND Rust receive handlers (reject/truncate messages exceeding limit). Applies to DMs and channel messages. Edit messages same limit.
- [X] **Profile update field size limits** — `ProfileUpdate` accepts unbounded strings for display_name/status/about_me. Fix: truncate on receive (100 chars name, 200 status, 500 about_me).
- [X] **Markdown parser recursion depth** — `_parseInline` in `message_text_parser.dart` is recursive with no depth limit. Deeply nested formatting (5000+ levels) could stack overflow. Fix: add `depth` parameter, cap at 10 levels, treat remainder as plain text.
- [X] **Reaction emoji validation** — modified clients can send arbitrary strings as emojis. Fix: reject emoji strings longer than 10 characters on receive.
- [X] **FileHeader height=0 division guard** — aspect ratio calculation divides by height. Fix: guard `height > 0` before division in `FileAttachmentWidget`.
- [X] **Event dispatch try-catch** — `_dispatch` in `event_provider.dart` not wrapped in try-catch. An exception in any handler could kill the event loop. Fix: wrap in `try { ... } catch (e) { debugPrint(...) }`.
- [X] **Profile card OverlayEntry disposal** — `entry.dispose()` never called after `entry.remove()` in `profile_card_popup.dart`. Fix: add `entry.dispose()` after remove.
- [X] **`getrandom::fill().unwrap()` panic** — extremely rare but would crash the app. Fix: handle error gracefully or use `expect` with descriptive message.

**INFRASTRUCTURE — relay server hardening:**
- [X] **Disable password SSH** — switch to SSH key-only authentication. Password SSH is the #1 attack vector for VPS servers (automated bots try common passwords 24/7). Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: `PasswordAuthentication no`, `PubkeyAuthentication yes`. Add your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` first.
- [X] **Firewall rules (UFW)** — allow only: 22/tcp (SSH), 443/tcp (WSS/Nginx), 4001/tcp (libp2p relay), 9001/tcp (internal only, Nginx→relay). Deny all other inbound. Currently unknown what ports are open.
- [X] **Fail2ban** — auto-ban IPs after 5 failed SSH attempts. Blocks brute-force attacks.
- [X] **Relay resource limits** — systemd `LimitNOFILE`, `MemoryMax`, `CPUQuota` on the hollow-relay service. Prevents a misbehaving relay from taking down the entire VPS.

**Deliverable:** All known security vulnerabilities patched. Wire protocol hardened against malicious peers. Relay server hardened against unauthorized access and DoS. Ready for distributed storage (Phase 4) where peers store shards on each other's devices — trust boundaries are enforced.

> **Correction (2026-07-23):** the "Enforce signature verification" box above was ticked while only the CHANNEL path was actually enforcing. The DM path called `verify_message_signature`, logged the failure, and stored the message anyway — and the check was gated behind `if sig.is_some()`, so stripping the signature skipped it entirely. It sat that way for ~3.5 months. **A ticked box is not a test.** Regression tests were added with the fix. See section below.

### Security: External Disclosure Response (2026-07)

First external coordinated-disclosure report (Folf / `itsfolf`). Three reported vulnerabilities plus two found during remediation, all fixed in 0.8.2. Full record in memory `project_security_disclosure_2026_07`; the notes-to-self file is repo `tmp2.txt`.

- [X] **Authenticated Olm key exchange** — `KeyBundle`/`KeyRequest` are DEVICE-signed and enforced (`REQUIRE_SIGNED_KEY_EXCHANGE`). Closes relay key substitution. `project_signed_key_exchange_root_of_trust`.
- [X] **Relay binds `peer_id` to the supplied pubkey** — deployed to relay.anonlisten.com; self-hosters must rebuild.
- [X] **Share filename sanitization** — remote names through `safe_file_name()` before any path join.
- [X] **DM signature verification REJECTS** — and no longer skippable by omitting the signature; verified against RAW text before the length clamp.
- [X] **Remote panic on multi-byte text** — 4 byte-slice sites replaced with a char-boundary-safe `clip_text`.
- [X] **Visible key/device change warning (Issue 1-C)** — warns on a NEW DEVICE joining a contact's master-signed device list (the shape that carries an attack signal); Olm key changes recorded as a low-key reinstall notice. First device list is a baseline, not a warning. Persistent in-conversation banner, not a toast.
- [X] **Out-of-band verification (Issue 1-D)** — 60-digit safety numbers derived from the two MASTER peer_ids, so they survive reinstalls and device changes and move only when the person does. Verify Contact screen (desktop + mobile) with copy and paste-compare; verified badge on profiles; reviewable list in Settings › Security. No camera scanning — `mobile_scanner` has no Windows/Linux support, so it could never be the primary path.

C and D live on `security/0.8.2-continuation`. Both: `project_contact_verification_safety_numbers`.

### Phase 4: Shared Vault — Distributed Storage

**Goal:** The core innovation — distributed file storage across members. Vault handles **files/media only** (not messages/CRDTs). Automatic mode: full replication for <6 members, erasure coding for 6+. DMs stay direct P2P. See section 4 for design details.

- [X] **Reed-Solomon erasure coding engine** — foundation for all distributed storage
  - [X] Add `reed-solomon-erasure` crate to Cargo.toml (pure Rust, no C deps, SIMD-accelerated)
  - [X] New module `vault/erasure.rs`: `encode(data, k, m) -> Vec<Vec<u8>>` (pad, split into k data shards, generate m parity shards), `decode(shards: &mut [Option<Vec<u8>>], k, m) -> Vec<u8>` (reconstruct from any k of n shards)
  - [X] `ShardMetadata` struct: shard_index, content_id, k, m, shard_size, total_data_size — self-describing header prepended to each stored shard
  - [X] Unit tests: encode+decode all shards, decode with exactly k shards (drop each combination of m), fewer than k fails, empty/single-byte/large (1MB+) inputs
  - [X] Benchmark: target >100MB/s encode/decode throughput for 1MB payload at k=10/m=5 — achieved 648 MB/s encode, 1085 MB/s decode

- [X] **Content-addressed storage layer** — local shard storage on disk
  - [X] New module `vault/content_store.rs`
  - [X] `content_id(data) -> String`: SHA-256 hash of encrypted data, hex-encoded (reuses existing `sha2` crate)
  - [X] `shard_key(content_id, shard_index) -> String`: SHA-256(content_id || shard_index as big-endian u16), hex-encoded — used as DHT key and local filename
  - [X] Local shard directory: `~/.hollow/vault/{server_id}/` with shards as `{shard_key}.shard` files
  - [X] CRUD operations: `store_shard()`, `read_shard()`, `delete_shard()`, `list_shards()`, `total_storage_used()` + extras (delete_content, list_content_shards, has_shard, get_shard_record, verify_server_shards, etc.)
  - [X] Integrity verification on read: `data_hash` column (SHA-256 of shard data at store time), verified on read — real tamper/corruption detection
  - [X] New SQLCipher table `vault_shards`: shard_key (PK), server_id, content_id, shard_index, k, m, shard_size, total_data_size, stored_at, last_verified, storage_tier, data_hash — own Connection to messages.db
  - [X] Indexes on (server_id, content_id) and (server_id, storage_tier)
  - [X] `StorageTier` enum (Standard, Low) — 26 unit tests passing

- [X] **Storage pledge system** — CRDT-backed per-member storage commitment
  - [X] New `CrdtPayload::StoragePledgeChanged { peer_id, pledge_bytes }` variant
  - [X] New field `storage_pledges: HashMap<String, AdminLwwReg<u64>>` on ServerState with `#[serde(default)]` (backward-compatible)
  - [X] LWW merge: members can change own pledge, admins can change anyone's (AdminLwwReg priority-based conflict resolution)
  - [X] CRDT server settings: `min_pledge_mb` (uses existing `update_server_setting("min_pledge_mb", "512")`, default 512MB via `min_pledge_mb()` helper)
  - [X] Auto-pledge on server join: new member automatically pledges `min_pledge_mb` (also auto-pledges on server creation for owner)
  - [X] FFI: `set_storage_pledge(server_id, pledge_bytes)`, `get_storage_stats(server_id) -> StorageStatsFfi { total_pledged_bytes, total_used_bytes, my_pledge_bytes, my_used_bytes, member_count, min_pledge_mb }` — lean struct, Dart computes online_members/vault_mode/health from its own providers
  - [X] `NodeCommand::SetStoragePledge` → creates CRDT op, broadcasts, applies locally
  - [X] Permission check in receive handler: self-change or Owner/Admin (same as NicknameChanged)
  - [X] MemberRemoved cleanup: pledge removed when member kicked
  - [X] 3 unit tests: pledge set/read, pledge removed with member, serde backward compat

- [X] **Adaptive k/m engine** — automatic erasure coding parameters based on server size
  - [X] New module `vault/adaptive.rs`
  - [X] `compute_adaptive_params(member_count) -> VaultMode`: returns `FullReplication` if <6, or `ErasureCoding { k, m }` using the adaptive table (6-8: k=3/m=2, 9-15: k=5/m=3, 16-30: k=8/m=4, 31-60: k=10/m=5, 61-150: k=12/m=6, 151-500: k=16/m=8, 500+: k=20/m=10)
  - [X] `apply_tier_multiplier(k, m, tier) -> (k, m)`: standard tier = 1.0x m, low tier = 0.6x m (rounded up, min m=1)
  - [X] `StorageTier` reused from `content_store.rs` (already has Standard/Low variants) — no duplication
  - [X] `determine_tier(mime_type) -> StorageTier`: audio/* → Low, everything else → Standard
  - [X] 15 unit tests: all member count brackets, tier multiplier rounding, edge cases, MIME type classification

- [X] **DHT-based shard placement** — deterministic mapping of shards to peers
  - [X] New module `vault/placement.rs`: XOR distance (SHA-256 normalized), `ShardPlacement` struct, `compute_shard_placements()`, `compute_full_replication_placements()`, `place()` unified entry, `local_placements()`/`remote_placements()` helpers
  - [X] XOR-distance placement: for each shard, hash peer_id with SHA-256 to normalize into 256-bit keyspace, XOR with shard_key, sort ascending, pick closest with capacity
  - [X] Weighted placement: per-member shard cap = ceil(n * peer_pledge / total_pledge), min 1. Members with larger pledges get proportionally more shards
  - [X] Self-placement: `local_placements()` filter identifies shards targeting our peer (no network transfer needed)
  - [X] Deterministic: members sorted alphabetically for tie-breaking, integer-only cap arithmetic (u128 ceiling division), CRDT-replicated pledges
  - [X] New SQLCipher table `vault_placement` in ContentStore: content_id, shard_index, target_peer, server_id, shard_key, stored_at, confirmed. 6 CRUD methods (save/load/confirm/delete/list_server/unconfirmed_count)
  - [X] Full-replication mode: returns all eligible members with shard_index=0
  - [X] 17 unit tests (placement) + 3 DB tests (content_store). 83 total vault tests passing

- [X] **Store protocol** — distributing shards (or full files) to target peers
  - [X] New MessageEnvelope variants: `ShardStore` (header + optional inline data), `ShardChunk` (for >256KB shards), `ShardStoreAck` (confirmation back to sender) — all Olm-encrypted via existing `HollowMessage::Encrypted` wrapper
  - [X] Full-replication mode: same wire messages, shard_index=0, data = full encrypted file
  - [X] Receive handler: verify server membership, check pledge capacity via ServerState + ContentStore, store via content_store, send ShardStoreAck back encrypted
  - [X] Send handler: `NodeCommand::StoreShardOnPeer` — inline data if <=256KB, else ShardStore header + ShardChunk loop. All via send_encrypted_message()
  - [X] Large shard chunking: shards >256KB split into 256KB pieces (reuses CHUNK_SIZE from file_transfer), `PendingShardAssembly` struct for reassembly on receiver
  - [X] 3 NetworkEvent variants: ShardStored, ShardStoreAckReceived, ShardStoreFailed — mirrored in api/network.rs FFI layer

- [X] **Storage tier configuration** — retention policies per data type
  - [X] Retention policies as CRDT settings: `retention_files` (default "365d"), `retention_voice` (default "90d") — uses existing `update_server_setting()`. `parse_retention_days()` + `retention_for_tier()` helpers in adaptive.rs. 5 tests.
  - [X] `determine_tier(mime_type) -> StorageTier` — already done in checkpoint 4 (adaptive.rs)
  - [X] New wire message: `ShardDelete { sid, cid }` MessageEnvelope variant — admin-only, MANAGE_SERVER permission-gated on receive. Receive handler deletes local shards + placements via ContentStore.
  - [X] `NodeCommand::DeleteVaultContent` + handler: permission check, delete local, broadcast ShardDelete to connected members. `delete_vault_content()` FFI function.
  - [X] `NetworkEvent::ShardDeleted` mirrored in api/network.rs FFI layer

- [X] **Retrieve protocol** — fetching shards from peers for reconstruction
  - [X] 5 new MessageEnvelope variants: `ShardRequest` (request shard by key), `ShardResponse` (inline or chunked data + found flag), `ShardResponseChunk` (for >256KB), `ShardProbe` (ask what shards peer has), `ShardProbeResponse` (list of shard indices)
  - [X] ShardRequest receive handler: membership check, ContentStore lookup, inline/chunked response via Olm
  - [X] ShardResponse receive handler: if found + inline → emit ShardReceived; if chunked → PendingShardAssembly; if not found → emit ShardRequestFailed
  - [X] ShardResponseChunk receive handler: assembly tracking, emit ShardReceived when complete
  - [X] ShardProbe receive handler: list_content_shards → ShardProbeResponse back encrypted
  - [X] `NodeCommand::RequestShardFromPeer` + send handler (connection + Olm check)
  - [X] 2 NetworkEvent variants (ShardReceived, ShardRequestFailed) mirrored in api/network.rs FFI

- [X] **File upload pipeline** — encrypt → erasure-code → distribute. 🎞️ Animate: upload progress with encrypt→split→distribute step visualization
  - [X] New module `vault/pipeline.rs` — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt, `VaultManifest` struct, `prepare_upload()` orchestrator, `UploadPlan` struct, `mime_from_ext()` helper. 13 tests.
  - [X] Upload flow (erasure mode): AES encrypt → content_id → erasure-encode with tier-adjusted k/m → compute placements → store local shards → send remote shards via StoreShardOnPeer → broadcast manifest via Olm
  - [X] Upload flow (replication mode): AES encrypt → content_id → single shard to all members → broadcast manifest
  - [X] `VaultManifest` struct with all fields. Replication sentinels: k=0, m=0, shard_count=0.
  - [X] New SQLCipher table `vault_manifests` in ContentStore: content_id (PK), server_id, channel_id, manifest_json, k, m, original_size, storage_tier, created_at, creator_peer_id. 6 CRUD methods + 7 DB tests.
  - [X] FFI: `vault_upload_file(server_id, channel_id, file_path, message_id) -> content_id` — pre-computes AES encryption + content_id, returns content_id immediately to Dart
  - [X] `NodeCommand::VaultUploadFile` + handler: prepare_upload → store local shards → send remote shards → broadcast VaultManifestBroadcast to all connected members
  - [X] `MessageEnvelope::VaultManifestBroadcast` + receive handler: deserialize manifest → save to ContentStore
  - [X] 3 NetworkEvent variants (VaultUploadProgress, VaultUploadComplete, VaultUploadFailed) mirrored in api/network.rs FFI

- [X] **File download pipeline** — locate shards, retrieve k, reconstruct, decrypt. 🎞️ Animate: image load shimmer placeholder → fade-in, download progress reconstruction
  - [X] `reconstruct_file(manifest, packed_shards)` pure function in pipeline.rs — erasure decode + AES decrypt, handles both replication (k=0) and erasure modes. 3 tests.
  - [X] Local vault cache: `~/.hollow/vault_cache/{content_id}.{ext}` — `vault_cache_dir()`, `cache_path()`, `check_cache()`, `write_to_cache()` helpers. 2 tests.
  - [X] `ext_from_filename()` helper for extracting file extension from manifest
  - [X] `NodeCommand::VaultDownloadFile` + handler: load manifest → check cache → collect local shards → reconstruct if enough → write to cache → emit Complete
  - [X] Cache-first retrieval: FFI checks cache synchronously, returns path immediately on hit
  - [X] FFI: `vault_download_file(server_id, content_id)` — cache check + async command dispatch
  - [X] 3 NetworkEvent variants (VaultDownloadProgress, VaultDownloadComplete, VaultDownloadFailed) mirrored in api/network.rs FFI

- [X] **Vault status indicators** — rich UI feedback for vault operations. 🎞️ Animate: progress phases, health pulse
  - [X] Dart: `VaultStatusNotifier` provider (`vault_status_provider.dart`) — VaultServerStatus, VaultFileStatus, VaultHealth enum (healthy/degraded/critical), tracks uploads/downloads/shards per server
  - [X] Event dispatching: 12 new case branches in `event_provider.dart` for all vault NetworkEvent variants (ShardStored, ShardStoreAckReceived, ShardStoreFailed, ShardDeleted, ShardReceived, ShardRequestFailed, VaultUploadProgress/Complete/Failed, VaultDownloadProgress/Complete/Failed)
  - [X] **Channel header vault health dot**: `_VaultHealthIndicator` widget — green/yellow/red `StatusDot` with tooltip, positioned after sync indicator. Pulse animation on non-healthy states.

- [X] **Rebalancing on member join/leave**. 🎞️ Animate: rebalancing progress indicator, shard migration visualization
  - [X] New module `vault/rebalancer.rs`: `detect_departures()`, `scan_under_replicated()`, `compute_repair_plan()`, `compute_migration_plan()`. Structs: UnderReplicatedContent, RepairPlan, ShardMigration. 9 tests.
  - [X] Departure detection: `vault_member_status` SQLCipher table in ContentStore, `update_member_last_seen()`, `load_member_statuses()` CRUD. Updated every 30 min for connected peers.
  - [X] Under-replication scan: `scan_under_replicated()` checks confirmed placements vs online peers. Flags content where available < k.
  - [X] Repair plan: `compute_repair_plan()` identifies missing shards, computes new targets via placement algorithm. Returns None if not enough shards to reconstruct.
  - [X] Migration plan: `compute_migration_plan()` compares old vs new placements when membership changes. Returns list of shard moves.
  - [X] Mode transition: already works by design — `compute_adaptive_params(members.len())` called at upload time, existing content stays at original k/m.
  - [X] `ShardMigrate` MessageEnvelope variant + receive handler (verify membership, store shard).
  - [X] 3 NetworkEvent variants (RebalanceStarted/Progress/Completed) mirrored in api/network.rs FFI.
  - [X] Background retention enforcement: 30-min timer in swarm select loop. Checks each server's manifests against `retention_for_tier()` + `parse_retention_days()`. Deletes expired content + placements + manifests.

  - [X] Sync UI fixes: "Syncing..." indicator timeout (clear after 10s if no progress), CRDT server state changes (rename/delete) refresh Dart UI on SyncCompleted

- [X] Rebalancer

- [ ] **Multi-relay server support** — distribute load across multiple WSS relay servers for scale and redundancy. Moved to Phase 6.75 Scaling section with full checklist.

- [X] **Connection subset management + gossip relay tree** — limit persistent WebRTC connections for large servers, enable tree-spread broadcasting
  - [X] Target: 6-12 WebRTC data channel peers per server (not full mesh). Total across all servers capped at 50 (configurable)
  - [X] Peer scoring: `PeerScore { uptime_ratio, avg_latency_ms, bandwidth_score, shard_overlap }` — computed from data channel ping RTT, connection duration, shared shard count
  - [X] Rotation: every 5 minutes, drop lowest-scoring peer, connect to highest-scoring unconnected peer. Max 1 rotation per cycle for stability
  - [X] Priority connections: always maintain connections to peers holding shards of recently accessed content (shard_overlap weighted heavily)
  - [X] Gossip peer exchange: `HavenMessage::PeerExchange { server_id, peers }` — connected peers share known peer lists for the server via WSS relay
  - [X] Gossip relay tree (broadcast forwarding): when a peer receives data tagged as broadcast (images, files), automatically re-send to its connected WebRTC subset (minus source). Covers 1000+ members in ~3 hops (~600ms), 0 bytes through VPS
  - [X] Broadcast deduplication: each broadcast gets unique ID, peers track recent IDs and drop duplicates (mesh has cycles)
  - [X] TTL/hop limit: 4-5 hops max to prevent infinite propagation (covers millions of peers)
  - [X] Fallback: <6 reachable peers → connect to all available. 30s timeout on gossip delivery falls back to direct FileProbe

- [ ] **Channel-level CRDT sharding** — split monolithic ServerState for scale (defer until ServerState is too large). Moved to Phase 6.75 Scaling section with summary. Full design below for reference:
  - Split into `ServerCoreState` (name, members, roles, settings, pledges, channel_layout — small, synced by all) + per-channel `ChannelState` (pinned_messages, channel-specific settings — synced only by members who access the channel)
  - New SQLCipher table `channel_states`: server_id, channel_id, state_json, updated_at — PRIMARY KEY (server_id, channel_id)
  - Migration: on first load after upgrade, extract channel-specific data from existing ServerState into ChannelState objects
  - Scoped sync: SyncRequest/SyncResponse carry `scope` field ("core" or "channel:{id}") — peers only sync documents they need
  - Lazy loading: channel state loaded from DB on demand (user navigates to channel), not all at once
  - Memory budget: max 20 ChannelState objects in memory, LRU eviction to DB, active (open in UI) channels pinned

**Deliverable:** Server files live distributed across members. No single point of failure. Automatic mode selection — small groups get full sync, larger servers get space-efficient erasure coding. Rich status indicators keep users informed.

### Phase 4.5: Account Recovery & Backup — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Identity recovery and account portability.

- [X] **Security tab in User Settings** — recovery phrase viewer with spoiler toggle (numbered 4x6 grid), copy button, warning text
- [X] **First-launch Welcome dialog** — three paths: Create New Account, Restore from Recovery Phrase (24-word input + validation), Restore from Backup (.hollow file)
- [X] **Passphrase-encrypted backup export/import** — full account backup (identity.key + messages.db + optional vault shards) encrypted with Argon2id KDF + AES-256-GCM. `.hollow` file format with magic header. Wrong passphrase = clear error, brute-force protected by Argon2id cost (64MB memory, ~500ms per attempt)
- [X] **Mnemonic persistence** — 24-word phrase saved to SQLCipher DB on first generation, retrievable anytime from Security tab
- [X] **has_identity() FFI** — checks if identity.key exists on disk, drives Welcome dialog vs normal bootstrap flow
- [ ] Social Recovery (Shamir's Secret Sharing) — deferred, nice-to-have for users who lose backup + mnemonic
- [ ] Device Linking (QR code transfer) — deferred to multi-device/mobile phase

**Deliverable:** Users can recover their full account (identity + all data) via encrypted backup file, or identity-only via 24-word mnemonic. Backup is passphrase-protected with Argon2id brute-force resistance.

### Phase 5A: WebRTC Data Channels — P2P File & Shard Streaming

**Goal:** Establish direct peer-to-peer WebRTC connections for heavy data transfer (files, images, vault shards). WSS relay becomes signaling-only for data payloads. 85-90% of transfers bypass the relay entirely.

**Architecture:** WSS relay exchanges ICE candidates (tiny JSON messages). WebRTC `RTCDataChannel` carries file bytes directly between peers. TURN fallback on the same VPS for the ~10-15% behind symmetric NAT.

**How it works:**
1. Peer A wants to send file to Peer B
2. A creates RTCPeerConnection, generates ICE candidates (local + STUN + TURN)
3. A sends SDP offer + ICE candidates to B via WSS relay (tiny signaling messages)
4. B receives, creates its own RTCPeerConnection, sends SDP answer + ICE candidates back via WSS
5. ICE negotiation completes in ~200ms — direct P2P connection established (or TURN fallback)
6. File bytes flow over RTCDataChannel — zero relay bandwidth for direct connections

**Dependencies:** flutter_webrtc package (Dart), coturn (TURN server on VPS)

---

- [X] **ICE/STUN infrastructure** (TURN deferred to Phase 5B)
  - [X] Add `flutter_webrtc` package — upgraded to v1.4.1 (libwebrtc m144, `getBufferedAmount()` works on Windows)
  - [ ] Deploy coturn (TURN server) on VPS — deferred to Phase 5B (voice/video)
  - [X] STUN: use public Google STUN servers (`stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` + `stun1`)
  - [ ] TURN: own coturn server with time-limited credentials — deferred to Phase 5B
  - [X] ICE configuration in Dart `WebRtcService` (STUN URLs hardcoded)

- [X] **WebRTC signaling via WSS relay**
  - [X] New `HavenMessage` variants: `RtcOffer { sdp, conn_id }`, `RtcAnswer { sdp, conn_id }`, `RtcIceCandidate { candidate, sdp_mid, sdp_mline_index, conn_id }`
  - [X] Route signaling messages via `send_message_to_peer()` on WSS relay
  - [X] Signaling is peer-to-peer targeted (not broadcast)

- [X] **Peer connection manager (Dart-side, not Rust)**
  - [X] `WebRtcService` class in `lib/src/core/services/webrtc_service.dart` — manages RTCPeerConnection per peer
  - [X] `connectToPeer(peerId)` — creates offer, sends via FFI → Rust → WSS relay
  - [X] Connection pooling: reuse existing data channel if already connected
  - [X] Keepalive ping (30s, 0xFE byte) keeps data channel alive. Idle timeout 90s
  - [X] Auto-reconnect on unexpected close (2s delay). Intentional close (idle/manual) → no reconnect
  - [X] Connection state tracking via `WebRtcProvider` (connecting/connected/failed)
  - [X] Glare resolution: polite-peer protocol (lexicographically smaller peer_id drops own offer). ICE candidate queuing for early arrivals
  - [X] Proactive connection: triggers on `SessionEstablished` event

- [X] **Dart-side WebRTC integration**
  - [X] `WebRtcService` wrapping flutter_webrtc — handles RTCPeerConnection lifecycle
  - [X] Listen for signaling messages from Rust (offer/answer/ice) and forward to flutter_webrtc
  - [X] Send local ICE candidates back to Rust for relay forwarding
  - [X] Data channel message handler: receives file chunks, writes to temp file, notifies Rust on completion

- [X] **Rust-side WebRTC scaffolding**
  - [X] `NetworkEvent::WebRtcSignal` + `WebRtcSendFile` events (Rust → Dart)
  - [X] 6 `NodeCommand` variants for Dart → Rust control
  - [X] 6 FFI functions: `webrtcPeerConnected`, `webrtcPeerDisconnected`, `webrtcSendSignal`, `webrtcTransferComplete`, `webrtcSendComplete`, `webrtcTransferFailed`
  - [X] `webrtc_peers: HashSet<String>` tracks peers with active data channels
  - [X] `pending_webrtc_sends` for fallback on failure
  - [X] Incoming RtcOffer/RtcAnswer/RtcIceCandidate → forwarded as WebRtcSignal events

- [X] **File streaming over data channels**
  - [X] Modify `stream_to_peer()` in swarm.rs: if peer in `webrtc_peers` → emit `WebRtcSendFile` event; else WSS relay
  - [X] Chunking: 64KB chunks over RTCDataChannel (same frame format as `ws_stream_transfer.rs`)
  - [X] Progress tracking: Dart-to-Dart via `FileTransferNotifier.onFileProgress()`
  - [X] Both directions: sender reads from disk + chunks, receiver writes to temp file + notifies Rust
  - [X] Graceful fallback: `WebRtcTransferFailed` → sender retries via WSS, receiver sends `FileRequest` for DM fallback
  - [X] Early-arrival handling: `early_file_streams` HashMap stores WebRTC bytes that arrive before FileHeader (Olm/MLS via relay is slower than P2P)
  - [X] Stale transfer cleanup: new first-chunk for existing transfer_id discards old partial file (prevents AES key mismatch on re-request)
  - [X] `getBufferedAmount()` backpressure — prevents SCTP buffer overflow for large files (tested up to 131MB)
  - [X] Sender detects data channel death after send loop → triggers WSS fallback instead of false "Send complete"
  - [X] Download button shows "File is already downloading..." toast during active transfer (prevents duplicate requests)
  - [X] `logFromDart()` FFI function for Dart-side logging to hollow_debug.log (visible in release builds)
  - [X] All 8 `stream_to_peer()` call sites updated (vault shards, DM files, channel images, FileRequest responses)

- [X] **Vault shard distribution over data channels**
  - [X] `VaultUploadFile` handler: shards go via WebRTC where available, WSS fallback
  - [X] `ShardRequest`/`ShardResponse`: shard bytes via data channel, metadata via MLS (existing)
  - [X] No changes to placement algorithm or manifest format — only transport layer

- [ ] **Remove 34 MB default relay cap**
  - [X] Once data channels handle file bytes, relay carries only signaling — 34 MB cap becomes unnecessary
  - [X] Restore configurable file size limit (1–500 MB) for all servers regardless of relay
  - [ ] Keep a sensible default (50 MB?) to prevent abuse, configurable by server owner

- [X] **Connection quality indicators**
  - [X] Show in member panel: radio icon (accent color) for peers with active WebRTC data channel
  - [ ] Peer-to-peer latency measurement via data channel ping (simple round-trip timestamp)
  - [ ] Optional: show estimated transfer speed based on recent data channel throughput

- [X] **TURN credential management** — deferred to Phase 5B
  - [X] hollow-relay generates time-limited TURN credentials on WS auth (HMAC-SHA1, 1-hour TTL)
  - [X] Client refreshes credentials on reconnect
  - [X] coturn validates credentials against same shared secret as hollow-relay

- [ ] **Testing & verification**
  - [X] Test 1: Two peers on same LAN → should use local ICE candidate (fastest)
  - [X] Test 2: Two peers on different networks → should use STUN-mapped direct connection
  - [X] Test 3: Peer behind symmetric NAT (mobile hotspot) → should fall back to WSS relay
  - [X] Test 4: Transfer 100MB file over data channel → verify speed, progress, and completion
  - [X] Test 5: Disconnect mid-transfer → verify WSS relay fallback completes the transfer
  - [ ] Test 6: Vault shard upload with 6 peers → verify shards go P2P, not through relay

**Actual scope (completed Mar 29, 2026):**
- New Dart: ~600 lines (`webrtc_service.dart`, `webrtc_provider.dart`)
- New Rust: ~150 lines (HavenMessage variants, NodeCommand variants, FFI functions, `early_file_streams`)
- Modified: `swarm.rs` (signaling routing, `stream_to_peer()` with WebRTC preference, 8 call sites), `event_provider.dart`, `file_transfer_provider.dart`, `file_attachment_widget.dart`, `channel_chat_pane.dart`, `member_panel.dart`
- Infrastructure: none (STUN uses public Google servers, TURN deferred)
- **Throughput:** ~9 MB/s P2P, tested up to 131MB. flutter_webrtc 1.4.1 (libwebrtc m144)

**Key insight:** This is NOT replacing the WSS relay. The relay stays for signaling, text messages, MLS encrypted ops, CRDT sync, and FileHeaders (which carry AES keys — must stay encrypted via Olm/MLS). WebRTC data channels carry the heavy stuff (encrypted file bytes, shard bytes). The two systems complement each other — relay for reliability + security, WebRTC for bandwidth. WebRTC is faster than the relay, so bytes arrive before metadata — the `early_file_streams` system handles this race.

**Phase 5B (Voice & Video) becomes straightforward:**
- Same RTCPeerConnection already established for data channels
- Just add audio/video media tracks to the existing connection
- SFrame E2EE wraps the media tracks (flutter_webrtc 1.4.1 has DataPacketCryptor support on Windows/Linux)
- TURN server (coturn) needed for voice/video (can't fall back to WSS for real-time media)
- All ICE/STUN signaling infrastructure already working

### Phase 5B: Voice & Video

**Goal:** Real-time calls with E2EE. No central media server — peers forward audio/video to each other using the same WebRTC connections from Phase 5A.

**Dependencies:** flutter_webrtc 1.4.1 already integrated (Phase 5A). RTCPeerConnection already established per peer. Need coturn TURN server for ~10-15% behind symmetric NAT (can't fall back to WSS for real-time media).

**Architecture:** No traditional SFU. Instead, gossip-tree forwarding — each peer receives audio/video and forwards to their connected subset (~3-6 peers). This distributes the load across all participants rather than burdening a single "super peer" or the VPS. Same topology as Phase 6's connection subset management for file broadcast, but applied to real-time media.

**How it scales:**
- **1:1 calls:** Direct P2P (already have the connection from 5A). ~100 kbps audio, ~2.5 Mbps video.
- **Small group (2-5):** Full mesh — everyone connects to everyone. Each peer sends to 4 others. Trivial bandwidth.
- **Medium group (5-20):** Partial mesh via gossip — each peer connected to ~6 others. Audio forwarded through 1-2 hops (~100-200ms latency). Each peer: ~600 kbps in + ~1.8 Mbps out for 6 speakers. Fine for any home connection.
- **Large group (20-1000+):** Same gossip tree, 2-3 hops. Each peer still only handles ~6 connections. 1000 listeners covered in 3 hops with ~150-300ms latency. Perfect for "one speaker addressing an audience" or voice channels.
- **VPS involvement:** Zero for media. Only TURN relay for the ~10-15% who can't P2P.

### Phase 6.25: Security & Optimization Audit

**Goal:** Comprehensive security audit + performance/memory optimization pass. Last security audit was Phase 3.75 (Mar 16) — significant new attack surface since then (WebRTC, voice channels, screen sharing, camera video, gossip relay, SFrame E2EE).

- [X] **Security audit** — scan all code for vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10, WebRTC-specific: OSDP injection, ICE candidate manipulation, MLS group key leaks, SFrame key exposure, relay message forgery, CRDT conflict exploitation)
- [X] **Memory/resource optimization** — Full audit of RTCVideoRenderer, MediaStream, RTCPeerConnection, and FrameCryptor lifecycle across all WebRTC services. 15 leak scenarios identified and fixed:
  - VoiceService: old video stream disposed before replacement in toggleVideo(), awaited renderer dispose in _initLocalRenderer(), old remote stream disposed on renegotiation onTrack, synthetic stream disposed on error path
  - VoiceChannelService: per-peer FrameCryptor cleanup in closePeer(), _forwardedSources pruned per-peer, _prevEnergy VAD stats pruned per-peer
  - CallProvider: _cleanup() now disposes screen share services (prevents GPU leak on call reject/timeout/disconnect), _handleScreenOffer() disposes old incoming before creating new, _renegotiationInProgress reset in cleanup
  - WebRtcService: _pendingIceCandidates cleared in dispose(), app shutdown calls disposeAll() before exit
  - main.dart: added webRtcProvider.disposeAll() to _quitApp() for clean shutdown
- [X] Enable Flutter crash dump logging to `hollow_crash.log` (FlutterError.onError + PlatformDispatcher.onError → file sink)
What was done - Crash logging (lib/main.dart):
  - FlutterError.onError catches widget build/rendering errors
  - PlatformDispatcher.onError catches async/platform errors
  - Both write to hollow_crash.log with timestamps and stack traces
  - 5MB rotation (renames to .old)
  - Respects HOLLOW_DATA_DIR env var (for multi-instance testing)

#### Security Audit Findings (Apr 4, 2026)

Full scan of all code added since Phase 3.75 (WebRTC, voice channels, screen sharing, camera video, gossip relay, SFrame E2EE, TURN, relay). 21 findings: 5 critical, 6 high, 8 medium, 2 low.

**CRITICAL — privilege escalation, eavesdropping, network abuse:**

- [X] **VC membership verification missing** — All 13 voice channel `MessageEnvelope` handlers in `swarm.rs` now check `voice_channel_participants["{sid}:{cid}"].contains(sender_peer_id)` before processing. Non-participants are rejected with `[HOLLOW-SECURITY] BLOCKED` log.

- [X] **VC join/leave not validated** — `VoiceChannelJoin` handler now verifies: (1) sender is a server member via `server_states[sid].members`, (2) channel exists and is `ChannelType::Voice`. Both checks reject + log.

- [X] **Unbounded SDP payload size** — Module-level `const MAX_SDP_SIZE: usize = 64 * 1024` (64 KB). Applied to all 10 SDP-carrying handlers: VC offers/answers (6), DM call offers/answers (2), screen share offers/answers (2), plus RtcOffer/RtcAnswer for data channels. Oversized SDPs rejected + logged.

- [X] **TURN credential endpoint reviewed** — Credentials are time-limited (1 hour TTL) and coturn enforces its own allocation limits per user. Global relay-side rate limiting removed — it would create an artificial bottleneck at scale. The endpoint requires no auth by design: credentials are useless without a valid TURN allocation, and coturn itself is the enforcement point.

- [X] **Gossip PeerExchange injection** — PeerExchange handler now: (1) rejects if peer list > `MAX_PEER_EXCHANGE_SIZE` (50), (2) rejects if sender is not a current gossip neighbor (`overlay.neighbors.contains()`). Both checks reject + log.

**HIGH — resource exhaustion, key exposure, state corruption:**

- [X] **MLS-path VC signal rate limiting** — Added per-peer VC signal sub-rate-limiter (30 burst, 10/sec) via `vc_signal_rate_tokens` HashMap. Match guard on all 13 VC `MessageEnvelope` variants drops excess signals before processing. Passed as parameter to `handle_incoming_request`.

- [X] **SFrame key log sanitization** — `CallInvite` log line now shows only `key_len=N` instead of the raw key. Key itself still transmitted via Olm-encrypted DM (required for call setup). Full HKDF derivation deferred to post-launch (requires Olm session shared secret access from both sides).

- [X] **Call glare SFrame key preserved** — `_handleInvite()` glare path now uses `state.sframeKey` (our own key) instead of the remote peer's `sframeKey`. Prevents key injection during simultaneous call setup.

- [X] **Relay room membership enforced on send** — `ClientMessage::Msg` and `ClientMessage::Direct` handlers in `ws_router.rs` now check `room_entry.peers.contains_key(peer_id)` before broadcasting/forwarding. Non-members get message dropped + warning logged.

- [X] **Gossip broadcast TTL in wire format** — Added `ttl: u8` field to `BroadcastMeta` envelope (`#[serde(default)]` for backward compat). Receive handler caps at `MAX_BROADCAST_TTL` (8), rejects TTL=0, decrements before relaying. Send path includes `DEFAULT_BROADCAST_TTL`.

- [X] **Concurrent renegotiation guard** — Added `_renegotiationInProgress` flag in `CallNotifier`. `_handleSdpOffer()` drops offers during active renegotiation. Flag cleared in `finally` block.

**MEDIUM — validation gaps, resource handling, defense in depth:**

- [X] **SFrame key memory clearing** — `FrameCryptorService.setKey()` and `setSharedKey()` now zero key bytes via `key.fillRange(0, key.length, 0)` in `finally` blocks. Same clearing applied at both `setSframeKey` callsites in `call_provider.dart`.

- [X] **ICE candidate rate limiting (Dart)** — `voice_channel_service.dart` `_handleIce()` now caps pending candidates at 100 per peer. Excess dropped with security log.

- [X] **Remote video track try-catch** — `voice_service.dart` `_handleRemoteVideoTrack()` wrapped in try-catch. On failure, partially-created renderer/stream cleaned up, error logged, call continues (audio-only fallback).

- [X] **Screen share getDisplayMedia track validation** — `screen_share_service.dart` now checks `videoTracks.isEmpty` before accessing `.first`. Empty stream disposed + `StateError` thrown (caught by caller).

- [X] **Relay WebSocket message size limit** — `ws_router.rs` checks `text.len()` / `data.len()` against `MAX_WS_MESSAGE_SIZE` (10 MB) before processing. Oversized messages disconnect the peer.

- [X] **Relay connection limits reviewed** — Hard caps removed. The relay is a lightweight message router (JSON text + CRDTs); heavy media/files go P2P via WebRTC. systemd `MemoryMax` and OS file descriptor limits are the real caps. Artificial hard caps would just block legitimate users before the hardware gives out. Scaling is via multi-relay deployment, not per-relay connection limits.

- [X] **Relay binary frame rate limiting** — Binary WS frames now go through per-peer token-bucket rate limiter (100 burst, 20/sec). Rate-limited frames dropped with warning log.

- [X] **Relay timestamp skew tightened** — Both `ws_router.rs` and `signaling_http.rs` `TIMESTAMP_SKEW_SECS` reduced from 300s (5 min) to 60s (1 min). Nonce cache deferred (low incremental value given the tight window).

**LOW — minor hardening:**

- [X] **Relay room code format validated** — `Join { room }` now enforces alphanumeric + colons + hyphens + underscores + dots via `chars().all()`. Rejects room codes with spaces, slashes, null bytes, or other unexpected characters.

- [X] **SDP logging already safe** — Audit confirmed: Rust-side `hollow_log!` calls only log signal type, peer ID, and SDP size — never SDP content. Dart-side `_dumpSdp()` in `voice_service.dart` filters to safe lines only (`m=`, `a=sendrecv`, `a=ssrc:`, `a=mid:`, `a=msid:`) — never logs `c=` (connection IP) or `a=candidate` (ICE with IP:port). No changes needed.

**Deliverable:** Hardened, leak-free app with documented security posture.

### Phase 6.75: Polish & Launch Prep

**Goal:** Final features, platform testing, and polish pass before distribution.

- [X] **Channel sync fix** — MLS `ChannelProbe` silently failed after reconnection → plaintext `ChannelSyncRequest`. `mergeFromDb()` prevents data loss (Apr 6)

#### DONE — MLS/Encryption Audit (CRITICAL — silent failures after reconnection) — FIXED Apr 6
Audit (Apr 6) found 11 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH risk sites where MLS-encrypted coordination messages silently fail when receiver's MLS epoch is stale after reconnection. Pattern: sender encrypts OK → receiver can't decrypt → message vanishes → operation hangs. **All fixed** with 3 patterns: (A) plaintext HavenMessage for requests/coordination, (B) Olm fallback for responses/sensitive data, (C) plaintext broadcast for voice state.

- [x] **Vault shard operations — Olm fallback added (CRITICAL):**
  - [x] ShardRequest in rebalance handler — already had Olm fallback ✓
  - [x] ShardMigrate in rebalance handler — added Olm fallback
  - [x] ShardResponse in MLS handler (both found/not-found paths) — added Olm fallback
  - [x] ShardProbeResponse in MLS handler — added Olm fallback
- [x] **Sync responses — plaintext requests + Olm fallback responses (CRITICAL):**
  - [x] SyncResp in MLS handler — added Olm fallback
  - [x] ChannelSyncBatch in MLS handler — already had Olm fallback ✓
  - [x] ChannelProbeResp in MLS handler — added Olm fallback + Olm receive handler
  - [x] Post-Welcome ChannelSyncReq — switched to plaintext HavenMessage::ChannelSyncRequest
  - [x] ChannelSyncReq in ChannelProbeResp handler — switched to plaintext HavenMessage::ChannelSyncRequest
  - [x] SyncReq in RoomMembers handler — already had plaintext fallback ✓
- [x] **Voice channel state — plaintext broadcasts + Olm SDP/ICE (HIGH):**
  - [x] VoiceChannelJoin broadcast — MLS primary + plaintext HavenMessage::VoiceChannelJoin fallback
  - [x] VoiceChannelLeave broadcast — MLS primary + plaintext HavenMessage::VoiceChannelLeave fallback
  - [x] Voice SDP/ICE signaling — MLS primary + Olm fallback (IPs are sensitive)
  - [x] Voice audio/screen/camera state — MLS broadcast + plaintext HavenMessage fallback (5 new variants)
  - [x] Voice re-join after reconnect — switched to plaintext HavenMessage::VoiceChannelJoin
  - [x] Olm receive handlers added for 8 voice SDP/ICE MessageEnvelope variants + ChannelProbeResp
  - [x] Plaintext receive handlers added for 5 new HavenMessage voice variants (with security checks)
- [X] Server unread on startup — likely caused by the same MLS sync failure (sync never completes → unread count never recomputed). Should auto-fix when sync responses are fixed above
- [ ] Test distributed MLS committer: owner offline, member B processes new joiner's KeyPackage

#### DONE — Performance: Background CPU optimization (10-20% → near 0%)
DevTools profiling (Apr 6) confirmed: CPU usage in background is caused entirely by Flutter animations running at 60fps even when the app is in system tray. Not WebSocket, not Rust, not reconnection. **Fixed (Apr 6):** Created `SharedTickers` singleton (`shared_tickers.dart`) — one ticker drives all decorative animations. N per-widget AnimationControllers → 1 shared Ticker + ValueNotifiers. All animations auto-pause on window hide/minimize/tray and resume on restore/focus.
- [x] **Pause all repeating animations when window is hidden/tray'd** — `SharedTickers` implements `WidgetsBindingObserver` + `_HollowWindowListener` hooks (`onWindowMinimize`/`onWindowRestore`/`onWindowFocus`) + tray hide/show. Single `pause()`/`resume()` stops all animation tickers instantly
- [x] `ambient_background.dart` — converted to `SharedTickers.ambient` at ~15fps (`Timer.periodic(67ms)` instead of 60fps ticker). Wrapped in `RepaintBoundary`. ConsumerStatefulWidget → ConsumerWidget
- [x] `status_dot.dart` — all pulsing dots share `SharedTickers.pulse` (3s easeInOut ping-pong). N controllers → 1 ValueNotifier. StatefulWidget → StatelessWidget
- [x] `member_panel.dart` — `_SectionDivider` glow sweep uses `SharedTickers.shimmer` with local ping-pong + easeInOut transform. StatefulWidget → StatelessWidget, removed AnimationController + CurvedAnimation
- [x] `selection_shimmer.dart` — uses `SharedTickers.shimmer` (4s linear). StatefulWidget → StatelessWidget
- [x] `home_dashboard.dart` — `_ShimmerDivider` uses `SharedTickers.shimmer`. StatefulWidget → StatelessWidget
- [x] `chat_pane.dart` — `TypingDots` uses `SharedTickers.typingDots` (1.2s). StatefulWidget → StatelessWidget
- [x] `chat_pane.dart` + `channel_chat_pane.dart` — call overlay shimmer already uses SelectionShimmer (now shared). SpinningRefreshIcon uses RotationTransition (GPU-composited, negligible cost)

**CORRECTION (2026-08-23):** this fixed the TRAY/minimized case only. Foreground
idle was never measured and was still **69% of one core** — because the "single
shared `Ticker`" celebrated above IS a standing request for a frame at every
vsync, and three more Tickers plus a decorative 7s progress bar (an
`AnimationController` restarted by a 7s poll, so it never finished and never
stopped) held the pipeline at the display's refresh rate. On a 240Hz monitor
that is 240fps on an idle app. `onWindowBlur` also never called `pause()`, so
the burn ran the whole time the window sat behind another app. Now: two `Timer`
lanes (30fps/1fps) gated on listeners, no raw `Ticker`s left in `lib/`, idle
~2.5%. See memory `project_idle_cpu_frame_scheduling` and
`feedback_ticker_is_a_frame_request`.

#### TODO — Features

- [X] Fix the camera turning on when calling with video call
- [X] Add pill for camera/screen switching in DMs, just like it is in voice channels
- [X] Copying messages / Paste + drag-and-drop images into the input bar
  - [x] Message text selection + copy (SelectionArea wrapper, right-click "Copy" context menu)
  - [X] Paste images from clipboard (Ctrl+V detect image data, stage as attachment)
  - [x] Attachment preview in input bar (thumbnail/filename card above input, X to remove)
  - [x] Text + file together (type message AND attach file in same send)
  - [X] Drag-and-drop files onto chat (desktop_drop package, drop zone on chat pane)
  - [ ] Multiple files per message (model change: FileAttachment? → List — touches Rust/DB/wire protocol)
- [X] **Video preview in chats — DONE (Apr 7, 2026).** Inline preview-in-place player with auto-fading control bar (play/pause + scrub + timestamps + fullscreen) and a fullscreen viewer overlay. Tested working in DMs and <6 member servers; vault path implemented but not user-tested (no 6+ peer testbed).
  - [X] **ffmpeg distribution** — Bundled BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds LGPL static binary at `vendor/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-win-x64.exe` (~164MB unstripped), fetched via `scripts/fetch_ffmpeg.ps1` (gitignored). Bundled into Windows builds via `windows/CMakeLists.txt` install rule + `windows/runner/CMakeLists.txt` POST_BUILD copy for `flutter run` dev mode. macOS/Linux fetch scripts + bundling deferred until those builds happen. **Binary minification deferred to Phase 7** — see Phase 7 line "Strip / minimize bundled ffmpeg binary" entry. Establishes the first native-binary-bundling pattern in Hollow.
  - [X] **`VideoThumbnailService` (Dart)** — `lib/src/core/services/video_thumbnail_service.dart`. `findFfmpegBinary()` locates the binary next to `Platform.resolvedExecutable`. `extractVideoThumbnail({videoPath, targetHeight=480})` invokes ffmpeg via `Process.run` with `-vf scale=-2:480 -c:v libwebp -lossless 1 -compression_level 6` → returns `VideoThumbnailResult(webpBytes, durationMs, sourceWidth, sourceHeight)`. 10s timeout. Stderr regex parser extracts `Duration:` and the first `Stream Video: WxH` for source dimensions. Never throws — all failures return null. `ensureCachedThumb(videoPath)` writes `{file_id}.thumb.webp` next to the source video for lazy receiver-side extraction.
  - [X] **WebP thumbnails (not JPEG)** — chosen because Hollow's existing image pipeline already converts everything to lossless WebP via `image_convert.rs`. WebP at the source bypasses the Rust re-encoding (`should_convert_to_webp` only triggers for png/jpg/bmp/tiff) and matches the canonical image format. Half the size of JPEG at the same quality.
  - [X] **Wire format: `vthumb: Option<VideoThumbRef>` on `MessageEnvelope::FileHeader`.** Struct fields: `cid` (vault content_id), `ext` (mp4/webm/mkv), `name` (original filename for Save As), `size` (bytes), `dur_ms`. `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` for backward compat. New `video_thumb_json TEXT` column on the `files` SQLCipher table with `ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN` migration wrapped in `unwrap_or(())`. Threaded through `NodeCommand::SendFile`, `NetworkEvent::FileHeaderReceived`, the FFI surface in `api/network.rs`, the Dart `FileAttachment` model, and `event_provider.dart:535`. Five `MessageEnvelope::FileHeader` construction sites updated, two destructure sites updated. Five `insert_file_metadata` callers updated. Six `FileHeaderReceived` event emit sites updated. Four `SyncFileMetaItem` initializations updated.
  - [X] **`override_width` / `override_height` parameters on `send_file` FFI** — Phase 6.75 video preview also needed source video dimensions in the FileHeader so receivers render the bubble at the correct aspect ratio before downloading the video itself. The existing `image_convert::get_image_dimensions` only handles raster images. Solution: Dart pre-extracts video dimensions via `VideoThumbnailService.extractVideoThumbnail` before `send_file`, passes the source video's `width`/`height` through new FFI parameters, Rust uses them for non-image files in the FileHeader. Same wire format as images — `attachment.width`/`height` is the single source of truth on the receiver.
  - [X] **`_sendVaultVideo` pipeline (Dart)** — `lib/src/core/providers/file_transfer_provider.dart`. Order: (1) extract thumbnail to get content + dimensions, (2) `vaultUploadFile()` first to get the vault `content_id` (sync return, fast — bounded by file-read + AES, ~200ms for 50MB), (3) write thumbnail to temp `.webp`, (4) `network_api.sendFile()` with the thumbnail path + `vthumb` linking field + source video dimensions in `overrideWidth`/`overrideHeight`. Order matters: vault upload must finish first because content_id is non-deterministic (random AES key/nonce per call). Vault upload does NOT trigger a competing FileHeader broadcast — only the thumbnail's sendFile emits one, so receivers see exactly one bubble per video.
  - [X] **`VideoMessageBubble` widget** — `lib/src/ui/chat/video_message_bubble.dart`. Three internal states: `thumbnail` (image + center play button + duration/size badges) → `preparing` (vault download in flight, dimmed scrim + spinner + phase text) → `playing` (inline `VideoPlayer` at the same dimensions as the thumbnail, preview-in-place). Auto-fading bottom control bar (play/pause + `mm:ss / mm:ss` timestamp + scrub + fullscreen toggle) shows on hover, fades 1s after mouse leaves, stays visible while paused. Click anywhere on video → toggle play/pause. Click fullscreen icon → opens `_FullscreenVideoView` via `showHollowDialog` with its own controller and the same control bar. `currentlyPlayingVideoProvider: StateProvider<String?>` enforces single-video-at-a-time. `VisibilityDetector` auto-pauses when scrolled out (>50% off-screen).
  - [X] **DM/<6 server videos** — same `VideoMessageBubble`, but `videoThumb == null` and `attachment.diskPath` points at the actual video file. Lazy thumbnail extraction in `VideoMessageBubble.initState`: if no `.thumb.webp` cache exists yet, runs `ensureCachedThumb` in the background and `setState`s when done. Both sender and receiver extract their own local thumbnail from the bytes they have — zero network round-trip, zero wire format changes.
  - [X] **Sender `FileCompleted` emit fix** — the sender's optimistic `addFileMessage` builds a `FileAttachment` without dimensions; the receive path emits `NetworkEvent::FileCompleted` after `mark_file_complete` which triggers `_reloadChatForFile` → DB reload → fresh attachment with correct dimensions. The send path was missing this emit — added at `swarm.rs:4805` so the sender's UI follows the same DB-reload pattern as receivers. Fixes a latent bug where the sender's optimistic message was also missing `videoThumb`/`mimeType`/etc.
  - [X] **Save button** — extended `channel_chat_pane.dart` `onDownload` callback. New branch: if `attachment.videoThumb != null`, call `_vaultDownloadAndSaveVideo` which uses `videoThumb.cid` directly (instead of `getContentIdForFile(attachment.fileId)` which would return the thumbnail's id, not the video's), polls `fileTransferProvider` for the cache path with 60s timeout, then opens Save As with `videoThumb.name`/`ext` so the user gets `cat_glasses.mp4` not `{messageId}.webp`. Existing `_vaultDownloadAndSave` flow preserved for non-video vault files. DMs unchanged — they always use full-replication direct P2P, never have `videoThumb`.
  - [X] **Bubble dimensions** — `_resolveDisplaySize()` reads `widget.attachment.width`/`height` directly (single source of truth via FileHeader), max 320×260, falls back to 16:9 if dimensions unknown. Same code path as images.
  - [X] **Packages** — `fvp ^0.35.2` (drop-in `video_player` backend for Windows/Linux desktop, registered via `fvp.registerWith()` in `main.dart` after `RustLib.init()`), `video_player ^2.11.1`, `visibility_detector ^0.4.0+2`, `path ^1.9.0` (was already a transitive dep, promoted to direct).
  - [X] **Backward compat** — `#[serde(default)]` on `vthumb` means old clients ignore the field. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` migration in `unwrap_or(())` is safe to re-run. New videos sent before this build have `width: NULL, height: NULL` in the DB and render with default 16:9 — they'd need to be re-sent to get correct dimensions.
  - [X] **Test plan results** — (a) Send MP4 in DM → plays inline directly, dimensions correct on both sender and receiver, no vault. (b) Send MP4 in <6 server → same as DM, full P2P. (c) Inline player auto-fade controls + fullscreen + scrub + timestamps all working. (d) Thumbnails extracted lazily for old DM/server videos on first build. (e) **6+ server vault path NOT user-tested** — no 6-peer testbed available, code path implemented but unverified end-to-end.
  - **CRITICAL LESSONS:**
    - **Sender UI relies on the FileCompleted event to reload from DB.** Optimistic `addFileMessage` builds a stub `FileAttachment` with only `fileName`/`size`/`isComplete`/`diskPath`. Without a `FileCompleted` emit on the sender side, the stub never gets replaced by the real DB row → any field added to FileHeader (width/height/videoThumb/mime/etc.) won't show up on the sender side until they reload the chat manually. Always emit `FileCompleted` from BOTH the receive and send paths.
    - **`Resolve-Path` errors on missing paths.** Use `[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath` for path normalization in PowerShell scripts when the target directory doesn't exist yet (like a fetch script that creates the destination).
    - **`flutter_rust_bridge` `dataSource` field uses `Uri.file().toString()` on Windows.** Don't try to recover the original file path from `controller.dataSource.replaceFirst('file://', '')` — that leaves a leading `/C:/...`. Stash the original path as state when initializing the controller.
    - **`Material` ancestor required in `showHollowDialog` overlays for `Text` widgets.** Otherwise text renders with the yellow debug double-underline. Wrap dialog content in `Material(type: MaterialType.transparency)`.
    - **`ffmpeg-next` Rust crate is brutal on Windows.** vcpkg ffmpeg port is famously broken. Bundled binary + `Process.run` is the right call for desktop. Mobile (when we get there) will need a different path — `video_thumbnail` Dart package for Android/iOS via native AVAssetImageGenerator/MediaMetadataRetriever, since iOS/Android sandboxes block executing arbitrary binaries.
- [X] Link previews (URL metadata fetch + embed card rendering)
- [X] Image quality tiers (user-configurable WebP Q: Lossless / Balanced 50% default / Small 30%, ~95% bandwidth + storage savings)
- [X] **Cryptographic message verification ("The RAT Files")** — prove message authenticity, defeat fake screenshots
  - [x] Message Info panel: shieldCheck icon in hover toolbar + right-click opens RAT Files dialog — sender peer ID, timestamp, Ed25519 signature, public key fingerprint, SIGNED/UNSIGNED badge
  - [x] "Export Proof" button: copies JSON proof with message text, timestamp, context (server/channel/DM), signature, sender public key, canonical payload, verification instructions — anyone can verify with standard Ed25519
  - [x] In-app proof verifier: "Verify a Proof" section in Security tab — paste JSON or import .json file, runs Ed25519 verification via Rust FFI, shows VERIFIED/INVALID with message text, sender, context, timestamp. Replaces standalone CLI/web tool
  - [X] Fix UI bug in Message Proof for new messages + edits — canonical edit/delete signing payload (was ad-hoc `"edit:..."` / `"delete:..."`), `edit_*_message` main-row sig/pk overwrite, sig/pk threaded through all receive/send/edit events + providers, Proof dialog uses `editedAt` timestamp for edited messages, optimistic-send timestamp now hydrated from Rust's signed value (fixes VM timer-drift verification failures).
- [X] Favourites for the Friends strip instead of the "dump-all-friends" approach
- [X] Use the same screen sharing for voice channels as in DMs (show your own screen; DONE - and we put the max bitrate capping)
- [X] Proper profiling for the high RAM usage during the call with screen sharing and afterwards
- [X] Full images metadata strip for WebP/GIF
- [X] Add floating pill about sender/receiver screen share quality
- [X] Shows the audio channel as the default selection on the server (should select first text channel)
- [X] Fix bugged dialog for "Set Passphrase" (double press needed somehow) / Data export system (messages, files, identity — verifiable with Ed25519 signatures)
- [X] Fix the crash error (reflect to second_debug.log)
- [X] Server template export/import (share server structures)
  - [ ] Roles copying - deferred to checkbox later
- [X] Add ability to choose your camera device in User Settings
  - [X] Add a package for camera device selection + test
- [X] Download manager UI — popup card showing manually-saved files (Save button) with thumbnails + save paths + click-to-reveal in Explorer (with Win32 foreground lock bypass), plus active shard rebalance status
- [x] **Archive tab — personal data viewer + signed `.hollow-archive` export/import (part of "The RAT Files" protocol)**
  - **Philosophy:** SQLCipher DB is fully encrypted — the only way to see your own historical data (left servers, DMs with ex-friends, kicked channels, deleted messages you still have copies of) is through an in-app viewer. Combined with a portable, cryptographically-verifiable export format, this turns "your data is yours" from a slogan into a testable property. No PDF/EPUB/TXT support — those formats can be trivially edited, and shipping "signed PDF" would be security theater that undermines Hollow's reputation for cryptographic seriousness. **One format, one truth.**
  - [x] **`.hollow-archive` format** — zip-based custom bundle (Rust backend: `archive/exporter.rs`, `archive/loader.rs`, `archive/types.rs`)
    - [x] `manifest.json` — archive metadata (type: dm/channel, participants, message count, export timestamp, file mode used)
    - [x] `messages/{message_id}.json` — per-message JSON files with full metadata (sender, timestamp, current text, `hidden_at` marker if soft-deleted, reactions, reply refs, file_id ref). Include hidden messages too — they're forensic evidence, not absent data.
    - [x] `edits/{message_id}.json` — full `message_edits` table rows per message (old_text, new_text, edited_at, per-edit signature). Serializes the entire edit chain so the POV viewer can show "edited 3 times — click to see history" with each version independently verifiable.
    - [x] `deletions/{message_id}.json` — full `message_deletions` table rows (deleted_text, deleted_at, per-delete signature). Each deletion is itself a signed event ("Alice signed a delete op for message X at time T"), not just a tombstone marker.
    - [x] `reaction_removals/{message_id}.json` — reaction removal evidence (emoji, peer_id, removed_at, signature).
    - [x] `pubkeys.json` — sender public keys for offline verification. Per-message Ed25519 signatures preserved from the DB (same canonical payload as Message Proof dialog).
    - [x] `files/{file_id}.meta.json` + `files/{file_id}.{ext}` — attached media honoring the three file modes, with SHA-256 hashes for included files.
    - [x] `archive_signature.json` — **archive-level Ed25519 signature** signed by the exporter over a deterministic SHA-256 hash of manifest + all message JSONs + edit/deletion/removal hashes + file hashes. Turns the archive from "bag of signed messages" into "a snapshot I, peer X, attest to as my complete record." Catches selective omission without requiring a neutral god-view.
  - [x] **File embedding modes** (chosen at export time)
    - [x] Full — every file referenced by the conversation is embedded (biggest, best fidelity, fully offline-usable)
    - [x] Images only — embed images, skip videos and large files (compromise — conversation reads visually but archive stays small)
    - [x] Placeholder — no files embedded, just references with original filenames/sizes/hashes (smallest — viewer shows grey placeholder cards with metadata)
  - [x] **`.hollow-archive` loader** — Rust-side (`archive/loader.rs`) takes a zip, validates manifest, verifies every per-message signature (canonical payload reconstruction with `edited_at` parity), verifies the archive-level signature, returns read-only `LoadedArchive` data. Tolerant of malformed entries (skips + logs). Zero DB writes.
  - [x] **FFI API** — 4 `#[frb]` functions exposed to Dart: `export_dm_archive`, `export_channel_archive`, `verify_archive`, `load_archive`. FFI-safe result structs for all archive data.
  - [x] **DB query methods for archive** — `load_all_dm_messages` (including hidden), `load_all_channel_messages` (including hidden), `load_edits_for_messages`, `load_deletions_for_messages`, `load_reaction_removals_for_messages` on `MessageStore`.
  - [x] **Archive tab UI** — new top-level tab with icon on server strip / bottom bar (left of Downloads icon), replaces main screen when active (like Home tab today). Shell integration done: `archiveTabOpenProvider`, fade animation, Home deselects when archive is open.
    - [x] **Sub-tab 1: "My Data"** — two inner tabs (DMs | Channels) in left panel (~280px) + read-only chat viewer in right panel (expanded)
      - [x] **DMs tab:** all peers you've ever messaged (including ex-friends), sorted by message count. Search bar at top. Each entry: avatar, display name (or truncated peer ID), message count badge.
      - [x] **Channels tab:** grouped by server (collapsible headers with server name). Under each server: channels with message history. Each entry: channel name, message count badge.
      - [x] **Chat viewer:** reuses `MessageBubble`/`ChannelMessageBubble` with read-only data source. Shows ALL messages including soft-deleted (greyed out with AnimatedOpacity 0.4, "Deleted at T" banner). Edited messages show "(edited)" indicator. Hover actions: Save file, Copy text, Copy image, Message Proof dialog (shield icon). `SelectionArea` for text selection. `NotificationListener` for scroll-dismiss of hover overlays. No input bar.
      - [x] Export button in chat viewer header → export dialog (file mode picker + save + sign)
    - [x] **Sub-tab 2: "Imported Archives"** — archive list in left panel + POV viewer in right panel
      - [x] Archive list: loaded `.hollow-archive` files with verification badges (green shield / yellow warning / red X). "Load Archive" button + drag-and-drop zone (`desktop_drop` DropTarget). Remove button (X) per entry.
      - [x] **Persisted archive paths** — archive file paths saved to `app_settings` DB via `ImportedArchivePathsNotifier`. On startup, filters out paths that no longer exist on disk. Remove entry clears selection.
      - [x] POV viewer: same chat renderer as "My Data" but with **verification banner** pinned at top ("Verified — N messages signed by original senders, exported on [date]" green / warning yellow / invalid red). Hover actions: Save, Copy, Copy Image, Message Proof. SelectionArea + scroll-dismiss.
      - [X] **Imported archive file viewing** — files/images embedded in the `.hollow-archive` are unpacked to `filesDir` temp directory by the loader. The POV viewer's `FileAttachmentWidget` must resolve `diskPath` from the extracted temp dir (not `~/.hollow/files/`) so the viewer can open/display images, videos, and other files from the archive. "My Data" tab uses the real `diskPath` from the live DB (already works).
    - [x] **Post-launch enhancements (shipped Apr 12 2026):**
      - [x] Export all server channels — `ArchiveTarget::Server` + `export_server_archive()` FFI + multi-channel manifest with `channels[]` + per-message `channel_id`. Export button on server group headers in conversation list. Imported Archives viewer handles `archive_type == "server"`.
      - [x] Jump-to-date — calendar icon in archive header, `showDatePicker` themed with Hollow colors, binary-search + `ScrollablePositionedList.scrollTo()` for precise navigation
      - [x] Peer filter — filter icon in channel archive headers, `PopupMenuButton` dropdown listing unique senders, message list filters by selected sender, reply lookups use full unfiltered list
      - [x] Search within archive — collapsible search bar below header, case-insensitive substring match, match count + up/down navigation with `ScrollablePositionedList.scrollTo()`, current match highlight
  - [x] **Export dialog** — accessible from archive message viewer header (export button) in "My Data" tab
    - [x] Choose file mode (full/images_only/placeholder) — three radio-style cards with icons and descriptions
    - [x] Choose save path — `FilePicker.platform.saveFile` filtered to `.hollow-archive` extension
    - [x] Archive is generated by hashing the DB slice + signing with the exporter's Ed25519 key
    - [x] Success toast: "Archive exported — {size}" + dialog auto-closes
  - [ ] **Web viewer — `archive.hollow.app` (deferred but architecturally committed)**
    - [ ] Flutter Web build of the same POV viewer code (~95% shared with the desktop app — `ChannelMessageBubble`, `MessageBubble`, theme system, proof dialog all reusable)
    - [ ] Pure client-side: drag-and-drop a `.hollow-archive` file → parse in browser → verify signatures in browser → render. **No data ever leaves the user's machine.** No Rust backend required — Ed25519 verification via `cryptography` / `@noble/ed25519` WASM or pure JS
    - [ ] Static hosting (Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / GitHub Pages) — no server state, no database, no telemetry
    - [ ] Open-source in a separate public repo so anyone can audit the verification code and self-host mirrors
    - [ ] Killer use case: journalists, researchers, legal contexts — "here's a link to a `.hollow-archive` and a URL where you can verify it without installing anything"
  - [X] **UI framing rules** — always use the shield icon + accent color for archive badges. Verification status is shown at the top of every imported archive. "Exported by" line with full peer_id always visible. Never hide cryptographic provenance behind "advanced" menus — it's the point of the feature.
  - [X] **Edit/delete propagation model.** Edits and deletes are NOT CRDT-synced — they travel as dedicated `MessageEnvelope::EditMessage` / `DeleteMessage` envelopes through the normal encrypted message channel (Olm for DMs, MLS for channels). Both sender and receiver call `edit_dm_message()`/`edit_channel_message()` on their respective DBs, which means the `message_edits` and `message_deletions` rows — *with signatures* — are written on both sides. Two peers' archives of the same DM should agree on all edit/delete state. Security: only the original sender can edit/delete their own message (verified server-side at `swarm.rs:8237` and `:8293` — rejected otherwise). Archive-level signature still matters, but for catching **selective omission at export time** (exporter chose to include only a slice), not for smoothing over propagation gaps.
  - [X] **POV viewer edit/delete rendering** — hovering a message with `message_edits` rows shows "Edited N times ⟶ view history" → expands a timeline of every prior version with its own timestamp + signature. Messages with a `hidden_at` timestamp render as greyed-out bubbles with a "deleted at T" banner and the original text still visible (sourced from `message_deletions`). Both states are independently verifiable via the same Message Proof dialog used today.
  - [X] **Follow-up cleanup (not part of this feature):** `hide_dm_message()` / `hide_channel_message()` in `storage/messages.rs` don't cascade `hidden_at` to the `files` table, so deleted messages' file references stay queryable. File this as a separate fix — not an archive blocker, but worth noting. The archive exporter should handle file references on hidden messages gracefully regardless.
  - [X] **DONE: Preserve original message signature through edits.** Added `prev_signature`/`prev_public_key`/`prev_timestamp` columns to `message_edits` table. `edit_channel_message()`/`edit_dm_message()` now capture the current main-row signature/public_key/timestamp before overwriting, storing them in the edit row. Threaded through the entire stack: `load_edits_for_messages()` → `StoredMessageEdit` FFI → `ArchiveEdit`/`ArchiveEditFfi` → Dart `ArchiveEditEntry` → `EditHistoryIndicator` (uses `prevSignature`/`prevPublicKey`/`prevTimestampMs` at index 0 to verify original message text). Old DB rows and old `.hollow-archive` files gracefully degrade (NULL prev_* → grey shield). New edits get full signature chain provenance.

- [x] **FIXED:** "Verify A Proof" in Security tab was trusting the embedded `canonical_payload` from the JSON instead of reconstructing it from the individual fields. Changing message text, timestamp, context, etc. in the pasted proof JSON wouldn't affect verification. Fix: reconstruct `hollow-msg:{type}:{ctx}:{sender}:{ts}:{text}` from the JSON fields and compare against the embedded canonical payload before verifying the signature. Payload mismatch → "tampered" error.
- [X] Fix the icon outline size on the server strip (Gear is bigger than Downloads/Archive) — Settings icon padding was `HollowSpacing.sm` (8px) vs `xs` (4px) for Archive/Downloads in `bottom_bar.dart`. Fixed to `xs`.
- [X] Count the chat messages sizes in the Server Storage inside servers — Added `total_message_storage_for_server()` (`SUM(LENGTH(text))` on `channel_messages`), wired into `get_storage_stats()` for both `total_used_bytes` and `my_used_bytes`.
- [X] Add "disable animations" toggle in User Settings — `disableAnimationsProvider` + `HollowDurations` mutable getters + `SharedTickers.disabled` flag. Toggle in System tab LAYOUT section. Covers core Hollow components, shell transitions, popups, notifications, channel sidebar.
- [X] Audio file preview (listening inside the app; same as already working video previews)
- [X] Look into the logic of GIFs in the chat/profile (comparison; fix the "speedups" bug if present)
- [X] Add .gif for Save / Conversion of GIF to animated WebP
- [X] Evidence Recovery Pool (cooperative shard gathering for ex-members of dead servers) — server-wide invite-link-based pool via WSS relay rooms + WSS binary shard transfer. Archive tab → Vault Files tab shows shard status per file (X/k badges). `.hollow-shards` export/import for offline fallback. Recovery Pool dashboard with progress ring, member tracking, live status. Coordinator (lowest peer_id) computes transfer plans. Reed-Solomon reconstruction when k shards gathered. Join validation with 10s timeout, pending state prevents premature dashboard switch.
  - [X] Phase A: Vault Files tab in Archive — `get_vault_file_statuses` FFI, shard count badges (green/yellow/red), grouped by type, sorted by date
  - [X] Phase B: Shard export/import — `.hollow-shards` ZIP bundle (manifests + packed shards), export/import dialogs with results summary
  - [X] Phase C: Recovery Pool backend — `recovery_pool.rs` coordinator module, HavenMessage variants (Hello/Welcome/ManifestSync/TransferPlan/ShardReceived/Status/Stop), NodeCommand handlers, WSS room join/leave, inventory exchange handshake, PeerJoined/PeerLeft tracking, 9 NetworkEvent variants + FFI functions
  - [X] Phase D: Recovery Pool UI — `recovery_pool_provider.dart`, initiate/join dialogs (with 10s join timeout validation + pending state), dashboard (progress ring, stats, members, invite link), Leave/Stop buttons, event dispatch wiring
  - [X] Phase E: Shard transfer execution — coordinator election (lowest peer_id) after handshake, transfer plan broadcast, `ws_stream_send` for shard bytes via WSS binary frames, `pending_shard_streams` + `pending_vault_downloads` registration for auto-reconstruction, `reconstruct_file()` + `write_to_cache()` via existing `handle_completed_stream`, `VaultDownloadComplete` → `RecoveryPoolFileRecovered` bridge in Dart
- [X] **swarm.rs modularization refactor** — split the 13,259-line monolith into focused modules (final: 6,234 lines; envelope dispatch fully extracted)
  - [~] ~~Create `SwarmContext` struct to hold the ~40 shared state variables~~ — **won't do**. Rust's borrow checker rejects this pattern: `ctx.server_states.get(...)` borrows ctx immutably while crypto helpers need `&mut ctx.olm` / `&mut ctx.mls` simultaneously (~16-18 call sites). Working around it would require restructuring control flow, risking logic drift bugs in the CRDT/MLS/WebRTC state machines. Individual field params are fine — the slight parameter verbosity is the correct trade-off for this codebase.
  - [X] Extract `types.rs` (1,797 lines) — `NetworkEvent`, `NodeCommand`, `HavenMessage`, `MessageEnvelope`, all helper structs, constants, `dm_room_code()`
  - [X] Extract `crypto_handler.rs` (345 lines) — signing helpers, Olm/MLS encryption, key exchange, coordinator election, `peer_is_reachable`, `ws_room_for_peer`, `send_message_to_peer`
  - [X] Extract `sync_handler.rs` (1,357 lines) — CRDT ops, server/channel CRUD, member management, sync request/response, `flush_pending_sync_requests`
    - Named `sync_handler.rs` instead of `crdt_sync.rs` to avoid collision with `use crate::crdt::sync::{self as crdt_sync, ...}` import alias
  - [X] Extract `message_ops.rs` (1,007 lines) — send/edit/delete messages, emoji reactions for both DMs and channels
  - [X] Extract `social.rs` (390 lines) — friends, profiles, typing indicators, `send_own_profile_to_peer`
  - [X] Extract `vault_ops.rs` (791 lines) — shard store/retrieve, upload/download pipeline, recovery pool commands
  - [X] Extract `file_handler.rs` (919 lines) — SendFile, WebRTC transfer handling, `handle_completed_stream`, `stream_to_peer`, `broadcast_to_gossip_neighbors`
    - Named `file_handler.rs` instead of merging into existing `file_transfer.rs` (125-line utility module unchanged)
  - [X] Extract `voice_handler.rs` (616 lines) — voice channels, 1:1 calls, WebRTC signaling, `check_voice_mode_transition`
  - [X] Extract `gossip_relay.rs` (129 lines) — broadcast relay, peer exchange, rotation/eviction/exchange timer handlers
  - [X] Clean up dead code: removed `chunk_file`/`chunk_count`/`CHUNK_SIZE`, `file_stream_request`/`shard_stream_request`, `CrdtStore` actor, `xor_distance`/`local_placements`/`remote_placements`/`detect_departures`, `generate_one_time_keys_batch`/`is_outbound_only`, signaling `Register`/`UpdateAddresses` variants
  - [X] Updated `mod.rs` re-exports, `cargo check` + `cargo clippy` + `cargo test` all pass (232 tests, 0 failures)
  - [X] **Final pass: extract `handle_incoming_request` inner envelope dispatch — DONE.** All 43 `MessageEnvelope` arms (Typing/ProfileUpdate, ChannelMessage/Edit/Delete/Reactions, FileHeader/Chunk/BroadcastMeta, ShardStore/Chunk/Ack/Delete/Request/Response/Probe/ProbeResp/Migrate + VaultManifestBroadcast, VoiceChannel{Join,Leave,SDP×2,ICE,AudioState,Screen×4,Reneg×2,CameraState}, CrdtOp/ServerDelete/MemberKick/SyncReq/SyncResp/ChannelSync{Req,Batch}/ChannelProbe{,Resp}) extracted into their target modules as `pub(crate) async fn handle_envelope_*()`. `handle_incoming_request` shrank ~978 lines (7,212 → 6,234). Catch-all (DirectMessage/DmSyncBatch/SessionAck) left inline as a no-op log. VC rate-limit guard moved into `voice_handler::vc_rate_check`. 232 tests pass, 8 fewer warnings than baseline (44 vs 52).
    - `MessageEnvelope::DirectMessage` / `ChannelMessage` → `message_ops.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::ChannelSyncBatch` / `DmSyncBatch` / `SyncReq` / `SyncResp` / `CrdtOp` / `ServerDelete` / `MemberKick` / `ChannelSyncReq` / `ChannelProbe` / `ChannelProbeResp` → `sync_handler.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::EditMessage` / `DeleteMessage` / `AddReaction` / `RemoveReaction` → `message_ops.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::FileHeader` / `FileChunk` / `BroadcastMeta` → `file_handler.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::ShardStore` / `ShardChunk` / `ShardStoreAck` / `ShardDelete` / `ShardRequest` / `ShardResponse` / `ShardResponseChunk` / `ShardProbe` / `ShardProbeResponse` / `VaultManifestBroadcast` / `ShardMigrate` → `vault_ops.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::Typing` / `ProfileUpdate` → `social.rs`
    - `MessageEnvelope::VoiceChannel*` (all ~11 variants) → `voice_handler.rs`
- [x] **System audio capture (screen share audio) — Windows done via flutter_webrtc fork**
  - [x] Windows: WASAPI loopback capture wired directly into `getDisplayMedia({audio: true})` via a fork of `flutter_webrtc` 1.4.1 at `../flutter-webrtc-1.4.1/`. Captures default render endpoint in loopback mode, feeds 10ms PCM frames into a kCustom `RTCAudioSource`. Audio track is returned via the `audioTracks` list and `addTrack`'d directly to the screen-share PC (NOT attached to the MediaStream — that crashes libwebrtc's sender iteration).
  - [x] Wire into ScreenShareService: "Share audio" toggle unlocked, audio track added to screen share PC
  - [ ] macOS: ScreenCaptureKit audio capture (Swift, macOS 13+) — deferred, no test hardware yet
  - [ ] Linux: PulseAudio/PipeWire monitor source capture — deferred, no test hardware yet
  - [ ] Upstream PR to flutter-webrtc — submit once Windows implementation has baked in Hollow for a couple weeks
  - Note: Windows path uses a forked `flutter_webrtc` (at `../flutter-webrtc-1.4.1/`, git-tracked, 1 commit on top of release baseline). Pubspec points at `path:` until the PR lands upstream.

- [x] **Hollow Share — Private P2P File Sharing (encrypted torrent)** — Zero-tracker, zero-IP-leak, encrypted file sharing built on existing WebRTC data channels. STUN-only (no TURN — relay bandwidth reserved for messaging). Zero file bytes ever touch the relay.
  - [x] **Core protocol:**
    - [x] Share manifest: SHA-256 root hash + file name + size + chunk count + per-chunk SHA-256 hashes (`ShareManifest` in `node/types.rs`)
    - [x] Share link: `hollow://share/<base64url(version:1 || root_hash:32 || key:32)>` — 65-byte payload, 87 base64url chars, QR-able. Manifest is fetched-by-hash from the swarm
    - [x] Chunk splitting: 256 KiB plaintext → AES-256-GCM encrypted on-the-fly (key from link, nonce = `[0;4] || chunk_index_be:8`) → SHA-256 of ciphertext stored in manifest. Receiver verifies hash *then* decrypts
    - [x] Multi-source parallel download: scheduler tick (50ms / 20 Hz) does rarest-first piece selection across `peer_have` bitmaps filtered by `webrtc_peers`, caps in-flight at 4 chunks per peer, retries on 8s timeout
    - [x] Chunk verification: SHA-256(ciphertext) == manifest.chunk_hashes[i] before decrypt; tampered chunks rejected and re-requested from a different peer
    - [x] Seeding: completed files remain available; auto-seed on completion; toggle per file; persisted via `seeding` column in SQLCipher
    - [x] Auto-rejoin on app start: `seeding=1` rows rebuild in-memory state, reopen source files, rejoin swarm rooms before main loop. Missing files → mark stale + disable seeding
    - [x] Bandwidth coexistence: process-wide `SeedBudget` token bucket (20 MiB/s refill, 40 MiB burst) caps share uploads. Scheduler pauses chunk requests for 200ms after any messaging/voice traffic
    - [x] Persistence: `shares` + `share_chunks` tables in SQLCipher. Have-bitmap snapshot on every chunk arrival → paused/restarted downloads resume without re-fetching
    - [x] Zero-copy seeding: sender stores original file path (no encrypted copy). Chunks encrypted on-the-fly with AES-256-GCM (~50μs per 256 KB chunk on AES-NI). Temp files auto-deleted after WebRTC send completes
    - [x] Speed: 3-second sliding window throughput measurement (replaced broken EWMA). Honest bytes/sec display
  - [x] **Discovery & peer finding:**
    - [x] `share_open_link` is a pure probe — decodes link, joins relay room, requests manifest. No DB entry until user explicitly presses Download
    - [x] Manifest timeout: 10s countdown in the paste dialog. No seeders → returns to input with error
    - [x] Relay room rendezvous: signaling only — no public DHT, no tracker. Zero file bytes over relay
    - [x] STUN-only: `shareIceConfigProvider` returns no-TURN config so share traffic never consumes relay bandwidth
    - [x] **Dedicated Share transport (2026-08-03):** Share negotiates its OWN peer connection per peer (`_Lane.share` in `webrtc_service.dart`, `webrtc_share_peers` in Rust) over `rtc_share_offer/answer/ice` envelopes. It never reuses the general `hollow-data` connection, which carries TURN — that reuse silently relayed every Share to anyone you already chat with. Remote `typ relay` candidates are refused locally, so the guarantee holds even against a peer that offers them
    - [x] `PeerLeft` cleanup: dropped peer is removed from every share's `peer_have`, in-flight requests freed for rescheduling
  - [x] **Chunk transport — WebRTC-only binary path:**
    - [x] Control plane (manifest req/resp, Have bitmaps, chunk requests) rides `HavenMessage` over the relay — small signaling messages
    - [x] **Bulk chunk bytes ride direct WebRTC data channels only (STUN-only, no TURN, no relay fallback).** If no Share data channel exists, chunks are skipped (not sent over relay). Scheduler only requests from `webrtc_share_peers`-connected peers — the SHARE lane's set, never the general one
    - [x] Wire format: `StreamKind::ShareChunk` + `TYPE_SHARE_CHUNK = 0x02` byte + 4-byte LE `chunk_index`. Identical in Rust `ws_stream_transfer.rs` and Dart `webrtc_service.dart`
    - [x] Receiver: Dart `_completeIncomingTransfer` branches on `kind == "share_chunk"` → calls `webrtcShareChunkComplete` FFI → Rust verify+decrypt+write+progress+complete
    - [x] **WebRTC auto-reconnection:** `ShareNeedWebRtc { peer_id }` event emitted when scheduler detects a peer in `peer_have` but not in `webrtc_share_peers`. Dart calls `ensureShareConnection()` to re-establish the STUN-only Share data channel. Download resumes automatically
    - [x] Sender-side temp cleanup: `.send_*.tmp` files deleted after WebRTC send completes via `handle_webrtc_send_complete`
  - [x] **UI — Share tab in app:**
    - [x] **Shell integration:** Share icon on bottom bar (dock mode) + server strip (classic mode), follows Archive pattern. `hollow_shell.dart:_buildChatOrEmpty()` checks `shareTabOpenProvider` before `archiveTabOpenProvider`. All navigation paths (Home, Archive, server, peer selection) clear share state
    - [x] **ShareDashboard** — single-panel scrollable list, header with "Share a File" + "Paste Link" buttons. Two grouped sections: "Downloading" (progress bar, chunks, seeds, speed, cancel) and "Seeding" (uploaded, peers, copy link, show in folder, seeding toggle, remove)
    - [x] **Paste Link dialog** — 3-state flow: input (with validation) → loading (10s countdown, cancel cleans up) → confirm (file name, size, chunks, Download/Cancel). Download only starts when user presses Download — no auto-start
    - [x] **Progress:** 3-second sliding window throughput (honest bytes/sec, not inflated EWMA). Per-chunk from Rust — no Flutter-side byte counting
    - [x] **Share creation:** "Share a File" → FilePicker → `share_create_from_file` → stores original path (zero copy) → emits `ShareCreated` with link. Copy Link button on seeding card
    - [x] **Real-time seeder updates:** tick emits `ShareSeedingChanged` every 2s with live `bytes_uploaded` + `peers` count
    - [x] **Seeding survives restarts:** DB `seeding=1` set on download completion. `auto_rejoin_seeders` reopens source files on app start. Toggle off→on reopens file from DB `disk_path`
    - [x] **Stale entry cleanup:** missing files → mark stale + disable seeding on startup/tick. Orphan `(unknown)` DB entries cleaned on `shareList`. Orphan `.send_*.tmp` files pruned
    - [x] **Toggle state cached:** `handleShareList` preserves in-memory seeding/progress state when merging with DB, preventing OFF→ON flicker on tab switch
  - [x] **Privacy & security:**
    - [x] No tracker server — relay only does WebRTC signaling (SDP/ICE exchange), never touches file data
    - [x] No IP exposure — ICE candidates exchanged via encrypted relay, never published to a public DHT
    - [x] Encrypted in transit — WebRTC DTLS on data channels + every chunk independently AES-256-GCM encrypted with per-link key
    - [x] ISP-invisible — looks like normal WebRTC traffic, no protocol fingerprint to throttle
    - [x] Always-on per-chunk encryption — link IS access control, chunks unreadable without it
  - **Implementation files:**
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/node/share_handler.rs` (~1600 lines, NEW) — link codec, on-the-fly AES-256-GCM crypto, swarm registry, all command + envelope handlers, scheduler tick (20 Hz), `SeedBudget` (20 MiB/s), `auto_rejoin_seeders`, `finalize_completed_download`, `ChunkBitmap`, 9 unit tests
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/node/types.rs` — `ShareManifest`, 5 `HavenMessage` variants (share rides `HavenMessage`, NOT `MessageEnvelope`), 7 `NodeCommand`, 8 `NetworkEvent` (incl. `ShareNeedWebRtc`)
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/storage/messages.rs` — `shares` + `share_chunks` tables, `StoredShare`, 11 DB methods
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/api/share.rs` (NEW) + `api/network.rs` — 8 `#[frb]` functions, `ShareEntry`/`ShareLinkInfo` FFI structs, `to_ffi_event` arms
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/node/swarm.rs` — registry, `SeedBudget`, `last_message_traffic`, 50ms share tick timer, command dispatch, envelope intercept, `PeerLeft` cleanup, auto-rejoin
    - `rust/hollow_core/src/node/file_handler.rs` — sender-side `.send_*.tmp` cleanup in `handle_webrtc_send_complete`
    - `lib/src/core/providers/share_tab_provider.dart` (NEW) — `shareTabOpenProvider`, `ShareTabNotifier` with live list state, pending manifest tracking, toggle state caching
    - `lib/src/core/providers/event_provider.dart` — Share event dispatch + `ShareNeedWebRtc` → `ensureShareConnection`
    - `lib/src/core/providers/ice_config_provider.dart` — `shareIceConfigProvider` (STUN-only)
    - `lib/src/ui/share/share_dashboard.dart` (NEW) — main dashboard, header, empty state, grouped list
    - `lib/src/ui/share/share_card.dart` (NEW) — download/seeding/failed card modes, progress bar, speed, toggle, show in folder
    - `lib/src/ui/share/paste_link_dialog.dart` (NEW) — 3-state dialog with 10s countdown, cancel cleanup, no auto-start
    - `lib/src/ui/shell/bottom_bar.dart` — Share icon + `_openShare()` + mutual exclusion with Archive
    - `lib/src/ui/shell/server_strip.dart` — Share icon in classic layout
    - `lib/src/ui/shell/hollow_shell.dart` — `shareTabOpenProvider` check in `_buildChatOrEmpty`

- [X] Fix channel + DM history race on first open after receiving a message; auto-scroll to bottom when in capture zone, pill otherwise
- [X] Fix audio card preview update on download
- [X] Check if there is a Search bar in Incoming/Outgoing friend requests
- [X] Voice recordings in the chat — tap-to-record mic button beside the file picker in DM + channel inputs. Opus-in-Ogg @ 16 kHz mono 24 kbps (~90 KB per 30s, ~8-10× smaller than MP3 at equivalent voice quality). Live waveform + pulsing rec dot + timer. Reuses existing `sendFile()` pipeline so voice messages are E2EE + signed like any attachment. 34-hour hard cap to mirror the 34 MB DM vibe.
- [X] **Fix file transfer progress bar (DM/channel file sends).** WebRTC streaming transfers (`total_chunks = 0`) have broken progress: Dart WebRTC receives bytes and updates `onProgress` every 512 KB (`webrtc_service.dart:624`), but Rust only learns about the transfer when the entire file finishes via `webrtcTransferComplete`. Rust then decrypts the whole blob and emits a single `FileCompleted` — no intermediate `FileProgress` events. Result: progress bar sits at ~10% then jumps to 100%. Fix: either (a) bridge Dart's byte-level progress directly to `fileTransferProvider` without waiting for Rust (pure Dart fix — progress = bytes received / total, skip Rust events for streaming transfers), or (b) convert streaming transfers to chunked transfers so Rust can emit `FileProgress` per chunk like Share does. Option (a) is simpler but progress won't account for decryption time at the end; (b) is a deeper refactor but gives honest progress. Key files: `webrtc_service.dart:620-631`, `webrtc_provider.dart:40-49`, `file_handler.rs:560-630`, `file_transfer_provider.dart:394-427` ------ NO NEED TO! It's this problem and it can't be changed! Deferred into unknown.
- [X] 411 errors with -D warning on cargo clippy - wtf is that? — ~414 default-level warnings: 172 "ref immediately deref'd" + 104 "collapsible if" (auto-fixable), ~50 "too many args" (conscious SwarmContext-less design), misc. No bugs, no `-D` deny flags. Auto-fixable via `cargo clippy --fix` but noisy diff.
- [X] **Closed alpha launch system:** (a) ~~About tab in User Settings — app icon, name, developer, website, socials, feedback email, Flutter OSS `LicensePage`.~~ ✅ (b) ~~License key system — relay-side UUID key table (`keys.json` hot-reload 30s), WS auth handshake check (one key = one active connection, reject duplicates + revocation kicks), `/relay-status` endpoint, Flutter first-launch key-entry dialog with cached key.~~ ✅ (c) Obfuscated release build (`--obfuscate --split-debug-info`). (d) Open-source relay + protocol whitepaper (2-3 pages: Olm for DMs, MLS for groups, AES-256-GCM per-chunk Share, CRDT sync, Ed25519 identity). Keep Flutter UI + networking proprietary.

- [X] **Vault retention for <6 member servers (full-replication files).** Retention timer now also checks `files` table for channel files with `created_at < cutoff` and `expired_at IS NULL`. Deletes file from disk, sets `expired_at` timestamp on the DB row (keeps row as placeholder). Applied via `ContentStore.find_expirable_channel_files()` + `mark_file_expired()`. Covers all servers (not just <6) — catches any channel files not tracked by vault manifests.
- [X] **Expired file placeholder in chat/archive.** Added `expired_at INTEGER` column to `files` table. Threaded through `StoredFile` → `StoredFileInfo` FFI → Dart `FileAttachment.expiredAt`. `FileAttachmentWidget` renders a placeholder card (clock icon + filename + "File expired · {size}") when `isExpired`. Archive tab uses the same widget — no separate handling needed.
- [X] **Collapse storage tiers into one.** `determine_tier()` now always returns `Standard`. `apply_tier_multiplier()` and `retention_for_tier()` treat `Low` identically to `Standard` (backward compat with existing DB rows). Storage Dashboard shows single "Files" retention row. `retention_voice` setting ignored — everything uses `retention_files` (default 365d).

- [X] **Hollow link preview cards in chat:** Detect `hollow://share/...` and `hollow://server/...` links in message text, render rich inline cards (Share: filename, size, chunks, download button; Server: server name, member count, join button). Pure UI — parse the scheme in the message renderer, no protocol changes (same logic as if with the regular links).
- [X] **Video streaming + Share-backed large file uploads (core):** Files >34 MB in channels auto-create a hidden Share. `FileHeader` carries `ShareRef` (root_hash + encryption key) so receivers download via Share P2P infrastructure. Sequential chunk scheduling for videos (playback-order, 64-chunk lookahead). Circular progress bar on video card during download. Auto-download for files ≤169 MB, manual "Download" for larger. STUN-only for hidden shares (no TURN — relay bandwidth). E2EE preserved (AES-256-GCM per chunk). Files <34 MB keep direct P2P streaming as before. Infrastructure built: `VideoStreamServer` (localhost HTTP range server for progressive playback), `VideoStreamNotifier`, `share_start_from_ref` FFI.
- [X] **Video streaming refinements (Phase 2):** Follow-up work for the share-backed large file system:
    - [X] **(a) Receiver storage: vault_cache + "Keep & Seed" opt-in.** Downloaded videos go to `~/.hollow/vault_cache/` (LRU-evicted, 1 GB cap). Receiver does NOT auto-seed. "Keep & Seed" button on video card moves file to `~/.hollow/files/` and joins the share swarm — helps distribute the file. >1 GB files exempt from cache cap during active playback; evicted after playback ends.
    - [ ] **(b) Progressive playback integration.** Wire `VideoStreamServer` + `VideoPlayerController.networkUrl()` into `VideoMessageBubble` so videos play while downloading (sequential chunks → localhost HTTP range server → player). Currently videos play after full download. **Deferred** — `VideoStreamServer` + `VideoStreamNotifier` are built and ready, but wiring into the UI caused UX issues (buffering overlays blocking playback). Revisit when chunk delivery is more reliable.
    - [X] **(c) Auto-download threshold setting.** User-configurable in Settings, minimum 34 MB, default 169 MB. Stored in SQLCipher `app_settings`.
    - [X] **(d) Share management per server.** Group hidden share entries in the Share tab by server so users can see what they're seeding for each server. Toggle seeding per-file.
    - [X] **(e) Archive compatibility.** Verify Archive tab reads `disk_path` from DB for share-backed files. Export should work if the file is on disk (downloaded/kept); show "File unavailable — no seeders" placeholder if not.
    - [X] **(f) Sender hosting model.** Sender keeps seeding from original file location as long as app is running. Other members who "Keep & Seed" form a swarm — load distributes BitTorrent-style (first few downloads are sender-heavy, then swarm takes over). If all seeders go offline → file unavailable, card shows "No seeders". Future: "pin" feature to promote cached files to permanent + auto-seed.
- [X] Notification press not loading the chat bug.
- [X] When you close the app to system tray, then open it from tray - the taskbar icon disappears and defaults to "exe-icon" - Probably fixed
- [X] **Community server verification via Twitch OAuth.** Prevent spam/abuse on public servers by gating join requests behind Twitch follow/sub checks. Design: server owner connects Twitch once (username saved to local SQLCipher), sets static rules in server settings (e.g., `twitch_channel: "coolGuy123"`, `min_follow_days: 7`). Rules propagate via CRDT — owner doesn't need to be online. Joiner's client does the check: one-time Twitch OAuth via **Device Code Grant** (Public client, no client_secret needed) with `user:read:follows` + `user:read:subscriptions` scopes → refresh token stored in SQLCipher → on join, silently refresh access token → `GET /helix/channels/followed?user_id={self}&broadcaster_id={owner}` (Twitch Helix API, requires only the joiner's own user access token) → check `followed_at` ≥ min days → proceed with MLS join or reject. Access tokens expire ~4h, refresh tokens expire 30 days from generation (each refresh resets the clock, one-time use — store the new token). Mandatory: validate token via `GET /validate` on startup + every hour (Twitch compliance). Same pattern extends to sub checks (`GET /helix/subscriptions/user`), VIP status, etc. No broadcaster token needed, no relay involvement, fully client-side. Ref: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#get-followed-channels
- [X] **Owner-online join verification (optional toggle).** Additional security layer for Twitch-gated servers: when enabled, the joiner sends their Twitch proof (API response + Twitch user ID) to the MLS coordinator (server owner/admin). The coordinator independently verifies the proof against CRDT rules before accepting the MLS join. If the owner is offline → join is queued with a toast "Server owner is offline, try again later." Fully resistant to modified clients since the owner's client does the actual verification. Off by default (standard client-side check is sufficient for most servers). CRDT setting: `twitch_owner_verify: true/false`.
- [x] **Voice/video call STUN priority over TURN.** 1:1 DM calls in `voice_service.dart` called `await getUserMedia()` (100-500ms on Windows) between `createPeerConnection()` and `createOffer()`, eating into the ICE gathering window. Every other connection type avoided this — voice_channel_service pre-captures audio once at channel entry, screen_share_service captures before creating the PC, data channels have no getUserMedia at all. **Fix:** Split `_startLocalAudio()` → `_captureLocalAudio()` + `_addLocalAudioTracks()` and `_startCamera()` → `_captureLocalVideo()` + `_addLocalVideoTracks()`. Both `createOffer()` and `handleOffer()` now capture media BEFORE `_initPeerConnection()`, keeping the PC→offer window under ~15ms. Same pre-capture pattern voice_channel_service already uses. RFC 8445 ICE priority system (srflx=100 > relay=0) ensures STUN is always selected over TURN when both succeed — no two-phase or post-connect upgrade needed. Screen share TURN usage is a separate NAT port-mapping issue (second PC gets different external port that remote NAT rejects) — resolved by planned data-channel screen streaming architecture.
- [x] Auto-updater with version picker (upgrade + downgrade support via hosted version manifest) — `api/updater.rs` (Rust FFI), `updater_provider.dart` (Riverpod), Updates tab in Settings. Manifest at `anonlisten.com/hollow/releases/manifest.json`. Self-updating via .bat script with countdown
- [x] Update landing page / website (Svelte static site — Hollow card with early access info, Ko-Fi/Patreon support, legal pages at /hollow/privacy and /hollow/terms)
- [x] Privacy policy + Terms of Use (plain-language, covers: relay sees only transient metadata, E2EE, no telemetry, no message storage) — `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, `legal/TERMS_OF_USE.md`, viewable in-app via About tab
- [X] **Public channels & guest viewer (community issue #9).** Per-channel `is_public` flag in ChannelInfo CRDT. Public channels skip MLS encryption — messages are plaintext but still Ed25519-signed (authorship verification + tamper detection, same `message_signing_payload()` path). Non-members ("guests") can read public channels without creating an identity. Access via existing server join link — one link serves both "join as member" and "browse as guest." Broadcast channels are a natural subset: public channel + posting mode "Admin+" = Telegram-style broadcast, built from existing building blocks (no new channel type needed).
    **Guest viewer (in-app):** New icon on server strip (left of Share icon). Opens a read-only view reusing existing widgets — `ChannelSidebar` filtered to `is_public` channels + `ChannelChatPane` in read-only mode (no member panel, no input bar). Paste server join link → fetches public channel list + last N messages on-demand from online peers. Messages cached locally. No automatic background fetching — load on channel select or manual reload only.
    **Guest viewer (web):** New `/viewer` route on Svelte site (hollow.anonlisten.com). Similar layout to in-app viewer. Connects to relay via WSS, fetches from online peers. Same on-demand model — no server-side message storage, no moderation liability. If no peers online → "No peers available, try again later."
    **Sync for guests:** Online peers serve public channel messages to non-members who request them. Peer checks `is_public` flag before serving. Guest stores messages in local DB (or browser storage for web). No CRDT membership needed — simple message fetch + cache.
    **Key constraint:** Hollow never hosts or caches public channel content on any server infrastructure. All content is peer-served on-demand. This keeps Hollow as a protocol, not a platform — zero moderation liability.
- [ ] **Roles, permissions & channel access control (full system):**
    - [x] **Leave Server** — `LeaveServer` CRDT op, FFI export, "Leave Server" button in Danger Zone for non-owners (Owner must delete or transfer ownership)
    - [x] **Ban system** — persistent `banned_members` set in ServerState CRDT (AdminLwwReg<bool>), blocks rejoin at ServerJoinRequest handler. Ban/unban in Members tab, collapsible banned list with unban
    - [x] **Power role permission editing** — Tier-gated: each role can toggle permissions for roles below it (owner→all, admin→mod+member, mod→member). 6 permission toggles per role (MANAGE_INVITES removed — unused). Stored in ServerState CRDT via `role_permissions` HashMap<String, AdminLwwReg<u32>>. Real-time CRDT sync via `ServerUpdated` event
    - [x] **Labels (cosmetic roles)** — unlimited custom named + colored tags, no permissions attached. Multiple per member. Created/managed by anyone with `MANAGE_ROLES`. Labels tab in server settings with color picker, assign dialog. 5 CRDT ops (Create/Delete/Update/Assign/Unassign)
    - [x] **Channel visibility modes** — per-channel dropdown: Everyone (default) / Moderator+ / Admin+. Stored in ChannelInfo CRDT. Enforced in sidebar via `visibleChannelsProvider`, archive via role-filtered channel list. Currently UI-filtered only (see Option B below)
    - [x] **Channel posting modes** — per-channel dropdown: Everyone (default) / Moderator+ / Admin+. Stored in ChannelInfo CRDT. Enforced in Rust (`can_post_in_channel()` in message_ops.rs) + Dart (`canPostInChannelProvider` disables input bar). Reactions allowed regardless of posting mode
    - [x] **Send/Read Messages enforcement** — SEND_MESSAGES revoked: input bar replaced with "no permission" message + Rust-side rejection. READ_MESSAGES revoked: message area replaced with "no permission" screen
    - [x] **@Mentions** — `@displayName` and `@everyone` parsed with longest-match against member names (supports spaces), rendered as accent-colored chips. Autocomplete dropdown on `@` in chat input (arrow keys, Enter/Tab/Escape, avatar + subtitle). `NotificationLevel.mentions` now filters both system notifications AND unread red dots by checking `@everyone`, `@localName`, `@localNick`, or reply. Messages mentioning the local user get a static teal highlight background
    - [x] **Reaction roles (native, no bots)** — implemented as self-service label picker in the Labels tab instead of chat-embedded message. All members can tap labels to self-assign/remove. No special message type needed — cleaner than Discord's bot-driven approach
    - [x] **Invisible status** — `HavenMessage::StatusUpdate` + `is_invisible` flag on `ProfileUpdate` (both plaintext and MLS envelope). Rust loads `invisible_mode` from DB at node startup (zero-flash). Toggle in user settings, persisted via `InvisibleModeNotifier`. Member panel, friends bar, home dashboard, DM headers, user bar, bottom bar all filter invisible peers. Typing indicators suppressed. Invisible peer appears offline everywhere — server members, DM status, profile cards
    - [X] **Per-channel MLS subgroups (Option B)** — cryptographic enforcement of channel visibility. Restricted channels get their own MLS subgroup; only qualifying roles are added. Without this, channel visibility is UI-filtered only — all members receive and store all messages via the server-wide MLS group. Required before v1.0 release for true channel-level confidentiality
    - [x] **Mute member across all channels (timed OR permanent)** — `muted_members` map in ServerState CRDT (master-keyed, AdminLwwReg<u64> expiry ms, u64::MAX = permanent, lazy expiry — no timers). KICK_MEMBERS + outrank gated (same hierarchy as ban). Enforced at send (text + file) AND live ingest (receivers drop a muted member's messages — modified clients can't bypass). Mute action + duration picker (10m/1h/24h/7d/permanent) in Members tab, collapsible muted list with remaining time + unmute, input bar shows "You are muted" banner (self-expiring provider). Desktop + mobile
    - [x] **Slow mode per channel** — `slow_mode` secs on ChannelInfo (Off/5s/10s/30s/1m/5m/15m/1h dropdown in channel settings). Moderator+ exempt (Discord behavior). Enforced send-side (signed-timestamp gap vs own last message) + live-ingest (receivers drop messages inside another message's window). Input bar countdown pill after each send. Desktop + mobile
    - [x] **Media-only channels** — `media_only` flag on ChannelInfo; only inline-renderable media (images/GIFs/videos) allowed, captions ride the file message; standalone text + other file types (PDF/exe/…) rejected at send AND dropped at ingest (FileHeader mime/img check). File picker auto-filters to media in these channels. Also closed a legacy gap: channel FILE sends now run `can_post_in_channel` (was text-only). Desktop + mobile. All three verified by `moderation_trio_mute_slowmode_mediaonly` harness test
    - [ ] Custom power roles beyond the 4 tiers (e.g., "Channel Manager" with hand-picked permission bits, custom hierarchy position). Later addition — useful for larger communities
- [X] Performance, quality, and QA audit — stress-test at scale (1000+ members), optimize: MLS coordinator load distribution (spread commits across multiple trusted peers instead of single lowest-ID), lazy member panel rendering (virtualized list, don't load all 2k profiles at once), profile broadcast batching/throttling, CRDT op log compaction tuning, per-channel MLS subgroups (Option B) for true channel isolation, offline→online edge cases (friend requests, role changes, message sync gaps, pending invites), compound DB storage growth analysis, WebRTC mesh limits, comprehensive "what if peer is offline" QA pass across all features
- [X] Topic-routed channel notifications — with relay topic routing, unsubscribed channels don't receive real-time messages. Need to ensure @mention notifications and unread badges still work for channels the user isn't currently viewing (may require a lightweight "notification-only" subscription tier or server-side mention detection). EDIT: i remember that claude did something with this. wait, no, we definitely have it implemented already.
- [X] Native screen share video on Windows — bypass libwebrtc's desktop capturer with Graphics Capture API → hardware encode (NVENC/QSV/AMF) → data channel, same out-of-process pattern as screen audio. macOS already has native ScreenCaptureKit path with crystal-clear quality; Windows still uses libwebrtc's built-in capturer which has lower quality and no HDR support. EDIT: kind-of working but not the same as on macOS... i guess still better than nothing cause at least lower resolutions are fixed and respected by the webrtc.
- [x] **Identity & database at-rest protection (two layers):**
    - **Current state:** `identity.key` is a plaintext 68-byte Ed25519 keypair (libp2p protobuf). SQLCipher passphrase is `hex(secret_key[0:32])` derived directly from it (`api/storage.rs:derive_db_key()`). Copying `%APPDATA%\hollow\` to another machine = full account takeover with zero friction.
    - [x] **Layer 1 — Optional app password/PIN (user-facing protection):**
        - Opt-in from Settings → Security → "Set App Password"
        - Derive a wrapping key from the password using **Argon2id** (same params as `.hollow` backup export: memory=64MB, iterations=3, parallelism=1) + random salt stored alongside
        - Encrypt `identity.key` at rest with AES-256-GCM using the Argon2id-derived key. File format: `[HKEYV1 magic][flags][salt][nonce][ciphertext]` = 119 bytes
        - On app launch: full-screen blur + password dialog → Argon2id derive → unwrap identity → derive SQLCipher passphrase as usual
        - Without the password, the identity file is encrypted noise — protects against both "copy files to USB" AND "sit down at unlocked computer"
        - Backward compatible: plaintext `identity.key` (protobuf header `0x08 0x01 0x12 0x40`) detected and loaded without unlock
        - Recovery: "Recover with phrase" button in password dialog → 24-word mnemonic restores identity and removes password
        - **Does NOT break identity export/import** — `.hollow` backup export always contains plaintext keypair (backup has its own Argon2id layer)
        - Settings UI: enable/change/remove password in Security tab, status indicators
    - [x] **Layer 2 — OS keychain / platform credential storage (machine binding, zero friction):**
        - Automatic on first launch (no user action needed) — existing plaintext `identity.key` auto-wrapped on Windows/macOS
            - **Windows:** DPAPI (`CryptProtectData` via `windows-sys`) — encrypted blob at `~/.hollow/identity.dpapi`, tied to Windows user account SID
            - **macOS:** Keychain Services (`security-framework` crate) — stored as generic password in login keychain
            - **Linux:** Not available — falls back to plaintext (password-only protection via Layer 1)
            - **Android/iOS:** Deferred to Dart-side (`flutter_secure_storage`) in future
        - Zero user friction — no extra password needed, the OS handles it transparently
        - Mutually exclusive with Layer 1: password replaces DPAPI (flags=0x01), removing password restores DPAPI (flags=0x02)
        - If DPAPI fails (identity copied to different machine): full-screen blocking recovery dialog with 24-word mnemonic entry. Recovery re-wraps with new machine's DPAPI automatically
        - Fallback: if OS keychain is unavailable (e.g., headless Linux), fall back to file-based encrypted identity.key with password-only protection (Layer 1)

- [X] Fix Olm/MLS issue in voice channels (probably the same stale MLS with the owner not getting it self-healed; the problem is that when peer B joins the VC, peer A doesn't see him somehow. only when he rejoins again, peer A sees him - something is wrong here)
- [X] First message is failing: peer A adds peer B as a friend, peer A writes a message and peer B doesn't see it; peer B writes a message but peer A sees it, the next message from peer A properly arrives to peer B - something is wrong with the initial first message or session establishment
- [X] Fetch profile data on the server for the offline peer from the online peer rather than trying to fetch from offline ones.
- [X] Add VAD for DM calls on desktop.
- [X] Input mic gain control for desktop/mobiles.
- [X] Temporary nickname taking for accepting the friends
- [X] Fix notification timing under rapid sends
- [X] Jumping chat on iOS (probably keyboard bug)
- [X] Unread notification about your own message when the other DM peer didn't read it
- [X] Server private/public (joining limitation)
- [X] Limit amount of people on the server (max member count limit for owners)
- [X] Profile popup on the name/avatar click inside the chat
- [X] Identity import/export on mobile
- [X] Photo library button on mobile
- [X] Proper markdown rendering of the news section text on mobile
- [X] Fix ringtone on mobile (iOS I guess, needs checking) — redesigned the ringtone TRIM dialog (the actual issue): sticky action bar + dialog maxHeight (fixes buttons clipped on small iOS screens) + scrubbable waveform selector with numeric ±nudge for long-track precision
- [X] Hollow Share warnings about STUN-only — yellow advisory strip below the Share dashboard header (matches the imported-archive verification banner styling) explaining transfers are direct P2P/STUN-only with no relay fallback
- [X] When another peer is trying to call a friend who's in an active call, it simply starts and immediatly finishes. Needs polishing — the callee already auto-rejected with a `busy` signal; the caller's `_handleBusy` just did it silently. Now toasts "<name> is in a call, try again later" on the caller. Two bugs found en route: a thrown toast aborted `_handleBusy` before `_cleanup()` (left the "Calling…" sheet stuck) → cleanup now runs first + toast is post-frame/try-caught; and `Overlay.of(navKey.currentContext)` throws "No Overlay widget found" (Navigator's own context has no Overlay ancestor) → `HollowToast.show` gained an `overlayState` param to insert into the root navigator's Overlay directly
- [X] Redesign the Settings
- [X] Detect no internet connection and show a warning
- [X] Offline label in Server header doesn't change itself when somebody is online.
- [X] NSFW label for server
- [X] Local notifications when desktop/mobile in background (proper ones)
- [X] Calls are too quiet. They need proper normalization and testing. Maybe echo cancellation or noise suppression are the main suspects here
- [X] **Olm session-establishment self-heal (desktop + mobile).** Fixed the intermittent bug where two peers both online + both connected to the relay would fail to establish (or silently drop) their Olm session, recoverable only by both quitting and reconnecting. Root cause: the relay never ACKs a direct message, so a single dropped KeyRequest/KeyBundle/SessionAck/PreKey stranded the `key_request_in_flight` flag forever (only a relay disconnect cleared it). Fixes: timestamped `key_request_in_flight` (HashMap<String,Instant>, 10s TTL) + a 30s reconciliation sweep that re-keys online peers lacking a *confirmed* session; `SessionEstablished` now fires only on real confirmation (SessionAck/decrypted reply) instead of optimistically on outbound-only sessions; a KeyRequest against a stale/unconfirmed session re-handshakes instead of being silently ignored; glare-defer refreshes (not clears) the in-flight timestamp; prune returns pruned peer IDs so handshake bookkeeping is cleared. Mirrors the existing `mls_bootstrap_requested` timestamped-retry idiom. Library audit confirmed no dep upgrade needed (vodozemac/openmls/uWebSockets/tungstenite already current or churn-only). New olm_manager unit tests for confirmed/unconfirmed state.
- [X] **Concurrent-media file sync robustness + bootstrap stall (the "disrupts the relay" bug).** Diagnosed from a real log: text-only DM sync is instant, but text + a few media files (audio + screenshots) caused a stalled image and a ~20-30s "disconnect" feeling. Two stacked, independent bugs — NOT a payload limit (files go P2P over WebRTC; relay caps are 64 MB, untouched). **Bug B (stalled image):** under concurrent multi-file transfer the receiver's completion was triggered by a byte COUNTER before the async IOSink durably flushed the tail, so Rust read a ciphertext short its trailing 16-byte AES-GCM tag → `aead::Error` → file dropped with NO retry (manual Download re-fetched the identical bytes fine). Fixes: (1) Dart `webrtc_service.dart` re-stats on-disk size vs `totalSize` after `sink.close()` before signaling Rust, with a short backoff retry, and signals `webrtcTransferFailed` if short; (2) Rust `file_handler.rs` auto re-requests on decrypt/assembly failure (bounded `FILE_DECRYPT_MAX_RETRIES=3`, re-inserts the `PendingFileStream` with `retry_count`) instead of FileFailed + delete-and-forget. **Bug A (bootstrap stall):** the relay is a single uWebSockets event loop serving both WS and HTTP; a WS frame burst starved the fresh per-poll TLS handshake of the client's HTTPS `/bootstrap` peer-discovery while WSS stayed healthy (relay confirmed healthy via SSH — no OOM/restart/CPU). Fixes: peer discovery moved onto the LIVE WS connection (new `discover_peers`/`discovered_peers` message, relay `ws_handler.cpp`); HTTP bootstrap made non-fatal + reqwest keep-alive/connect-timeout; removed the `[DEBUG] Bootstrap returned N peers` log spam that abused `NetworkEvent::Error`. **Relay:** replaced the detached-thread-per-push (`notify_push_sidecar`) with a single persistent worker + bounded queue to kill thread churn during DM/file-sync bursts. Relay rebuilt + redeployed. See session discussion 2026-06-09.
- [X] Connection stability rendering on mobile during connection instability. Dart-side: the `RoomCleared` event handler (`event_provider.dart`) did `peersProvider.clearAll()` + nulled `selectedPeerProvider`, blanking the mobile Chats tab / desktop chat pane and flipping all conversations offline. But `RoomCleared` only fires on an active-room SWITCH (legacy signaling model), NOT on connection loss — so it was destructive at the wrong time. Made it non-destructive (peers repopulate via PeerJoined/Members; selection preserved), consistent with `PeerDisconnected`/`PeerExpired` which already keep friends visible.
- [X] Slow "as if connecting" loading at startup — now renders the local DB first. Root cause: `_bootstrap()` in `hollow_shell.dart` was a sequential `await` chain with a blocking `fetchRelayStatus` HTTP call (5s timeout) sitting in FRONT of the local-DB loads (servers/friends/profiles/DM previews), so the conversation list waited behind the network even though it's pure local data. Fix: split bootstrap into a LOCAL-FIRST phase (servers, unread, profiles, friends, DM previews — all SQLCipher reads, no connectivity needed) that runs BEFORE the network phase (relay-status/license gate + node start). UI now populates instantly from local DB; the relay check runs after the screen is already shown. Applies to desktop + mobile (shared shell bootstrap).
- [~] **NAT-traversal hardening — router port-mapping via the `portmapper` crate (UPnP-IGD / NAT-PMP / PCP). ATTEMPTED & REVERTED 2026-06-14 — parked for later.** Research (2026-06-12) confirmed WebRTC's ICE agent already gives us ~90% of what Tailscale does for free — host/srflx(STUN)/prflx/relay(TURN) gathering, UDP hole-punching, ICE-TCP — and our relay already serves all three TURN URIs, so the only gap is router port-mapping. **Built (then reverted):** the full stack — `portmapper` crate maps one free local UDP port on node start; FFI exposes it; Dart emits a synthetic srflx candidate over the existing `'ice'` signal path on all 6 WebRTC PC sites (data channel/files, Share, stream, calls, voice channels, screen share). **The real obstacle discovered during impl:** stock libwebrtc gathers ICE on OS-ephemeral ports and the prebuilt flutter_webrtc fork exposes no way to pin them, so the mapped port wouldn't line up — fixing it REQUIRED rebuilding libwebrtc (added `ice_udp_port` → `set_min_port/max_port` + `PORTALLOCATOR_ENABLE_SHARED_SOCKET` in the webrtc-sdk wrapper). Windows `libwebrtc.dll` was successfully rebuilt; macOS/Linux would need the same via CI. **Why parked:** live testing showed the silent fallback works correctly, but the feature only helps when the router has UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP enabled AND peers are on different networks — and most consumer routers ship with UPnP OFF (Vitalik's own router is ISP-locked with UPnP off, couldn't even enable it). Best-effort, narrow real-world hit rate → not worth shipping now. All code reverted; Windows DLL restored to v0.5-alpha stock. Full design + rebuild recipe preserved in memory `project_nat_portmapping.md`. Skip the birthday-paradox symmetric-NAT trick. *Optional later sub-task:* move/duplicate TLS-TURN onto port 443 for firewall camouflage (coturn must coexist with the uWebSockets relay already owning 443 — SNI routing or a second IP). See session discussions 2026-06-12 + 2026-06-14.
- [~] **Decouple file persistence from auto-download (disk-space + ownership).** *(Partial 2026-06-22: the >34 MB Share gate is done — both DMs and channels now show a confirmation dialog ("Send as Share / Cancel") instead of silently auto-converting (channels) or hard-rejecting (DMs); DM Share enabled. The auto-download-card/don't-fetch-bytes part below is still TODO.)* Today ALL files ≤34 MB auto-download to disk in DMs/channels (>34 MB uses Hollow Share, which is desktop-only → dead on mobile). Images stay auto-download (negligible: 50% WebP ≈ 97% smaller, looks identical). For NON-image files (video/docs/etc.): deliver + persist the SIGNED FileHeader immediately (sender/ts/sig/hash = bytes-not-megabytes, preserves the evidence/ownership story), but DON'T auto-fetch bytes — show a type-aware card ("📄 File", "🎬 Video", "🎵 Audio", "📎 caption") with a Download button; fetch bytes only on tap. Verify FileHeader commits to a content hash so the header alone is proof. Decide where bytes live for reliable on-tap fetch (likely erasure-coded vault by default so it survives both peers offline). Push notifications: type-label only (NO background byte fetch — too heavy). Defer video streaming/transcode as a separate epic. See session discussion 2026-06-09.
- [X] **Storage management / cleanup tooling (needed regardless of the above).** *(Done 2026-06-22.)* New "Files & Storage" settings category (desktop + mobile) with a modern dashboard: total "Storage used" + segmented usage bar (Downloads/Vault cache/Held shards) + legend, per-conversation/server size breakdown with inline trash icons, and a "⋯" cleanup menu (clear all downloads / clear vault cache). Held shards are read-only (deleting them hurts group availability). LRU cap on `files/` (default 5 GB) + the existing vault_cache cap are now actually ENFORCED via `enforce_storage_caps` after each download (both were no-op sliders before). "Clear cached file bytes" keeps the signed FileHeader rows so messages render as re-downloadable cards. Also fixed a sender-side temp-file leak: the encrypted `.stream_send_*.tmp` was never deleted after WS-relay sends (doubled on-disk usage on servers) — now cleaned on all paths + a boot-time sweep of orphaned temps.
- [X] **Share system for DMs (large file support).** Currently DMs cap at 34 MB (hard reject). Extend the hidden Share system to work in DMs so large files can be sent P2P with chunking, resume, and sequential download. Needs: DM-context share creation (`serverId=null`, `contextType="dm"`), auto-download on receiver side, vault_cache routing, no seeding after completion (1:1 only). Until then, 34 MB hard cap on DM files.
- [X] **Multi-device identity & sync (major epic).** The 24-word mnemonic is the *identity*, not the *data* — importing it on a new device gives an empty DB (no central server to re-hydrate from). Symptoms: mobile import is empty while desktop is full; a friend request from the empty mobile device renders on desktop as "your own friend sent you a friend request"; two installs of one identity corrupt each other's crypto state. **Decided model (Signal-style):** one master identity (shared, profile-attached signed device list) + per-device Olm/MLS sub-sessions so both devices can be online at once; QR linking (desktop shows, phone scans) with a one-time symmetric key streaming a standalone-encrypted DB snapshot through the relay; sender-side fan-out for new messages; backfill from your other device first, conversation peer (signature-verified) as fallback; master-signed revocation with monotonic version (replay protection); and a **Sync Health panel** in Settings (per-device DB health comparison, manual Sync button, device management/removal). **STEP 1 DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED:** per-device random key (distinct peer_id, migration keystone), master-signed device list publish/ingest, resolver wired into all attribution sites, device-key→WS-transport key routing (master stays for identity/MLS/signing/DB), Dart `device_link_provider`. Two installs of one mnemonic now connect simultaneously with distinct sockets, no collision, no self-friend-request; profile syncs live.

- [X] Upgrade WebRTC
- [X] Ship VCRUNTIME140.dll (VS distributable) inside
- [X] System Status with message (left column Home shell tab + header), remove the Recovery Phrase card
- [X] DM push notification on iOS opens a different chat instead of the proper friend peer ID. ATTEMPT 2 (2026-07-01, awaiting device test): root cause pinned — `identityFor` reads ONLY the in-memory resolver, which swarm.rs warms *asynchronously* inside the spawned event-loop task; a buffered cold-start tap fires the instant MobileShell mounts (before the warm), so the device id resolves to ITSELF with no error → the `deviceLinkProvider` fallback never triggers → device-keyed empty thread. (The NSE proves the link IS on disk at tap time: it warms from `device_links` and stores the fetched DM under the master — which is exactly why the real thread has the message while the tap opened an empty one.) Fix: new FFI `identity_for_persisted` (api/network.rs, next to `identity_for`) — in-memory resolve first, and when it returns the input unchanged, open SQLCipher directly (same identity/passphrase pattern as `get_push_profile`), `warm_from_links`, resolve again; failure degrades to passthrough. `_openChatFromPush` (mobile_shell.dart) now calls it. Diagnosis if still broken: grep `hollow_debug.log` for `[HOLLOW-PUSH] identity_for_persisted: <raw> -> <resolved> (memory|db)` — if raw==resolved on the `(db)` line, the link genuinely isn't in `device_links` on the phone (then carry the master in the push payload / NSE userInfo instead). ATTEMPT 1 (2026-06-20) used plain `identityFor` + mirror fallback — failed for the cold-resolver reason above. Android unaffected (taps the Dart-posted local banner whose payload is already the resolved master). Channels fine (key on server:channel).

- [~] Add proper automatic gain for the audio (both input/output). *(MOSTLY DONE 2026-07-02 — device-verified, sound quality "fabulous". Shipped: the EQ+compressor+limiter chain below as a native capture post-processor in the flutter_webrtc fork (all 4 platforms, "Voice enhancement" toggle, live mid-call A/B, "Strength" knob = compressor makeup) + DYNAMIC MODE (default ON): a speech-gated RMS meter servos the input trim so ANY mic converges to the calibrated golden level (speech ≈ −28 dBFS RMS at the compressor input, +3.6 dB makeup — derived from the Shure MV6 reference 34% gain / 30% strength), sliders lock to "Auto"; manual defaults 50% gain / 30% strength; gain slider rescaled 34%–200% (key mic_gain_v2); iOS speaker-override enum bug in AudioUtils.m fixed. REMAINING — iOS LOUDSPEAKER: enabling the speaker introduces echo/noise by RECONFIGURING THE MICROPHONE (Apple VPIO re-tunes capture on the route change; with the mic config unchanged the sound is good). Needs proper research; do NOT retry bypassVoiceProcessing (tried — kills Apple AEC → feedback howl; see project_voice_enhance_chain memory).)* NEW: Fix the speaker on Android too! No screen audio from the other peer when the speaker is turned ON on Android ----- Tested between Windows/iOS. On iOS there is a problem that the audio is too quiet and it doesn't change no matter what. Also, feels like the speaker doesn't work right too. Overall, the entire pipeline needs to be fixed, but for a good, clear voice, I have a really cool idea - use EQ, Compressor and Limiter natively in our app (I guess with Rust) to apply to the microphone and serve it to the WebRTC (hopefully it doesn't require something like VB-CABLE, but if does - then we need to think of something else in order to drastically increase the quality of a call in terms of voice). My personal amazing EQ parameters out of Adobe Audition:

Frequency (Hz), Gain (dB), Q/Width (-/Hz), Band
100 Hz, 24dB/Oct, -- (doesn't apply), HP
110, 6, low shelving filter (adjust low shelve by 12 dB per cotave), L
291, -3, 1.5/179.3, 2
3000, 2, 1.5/1838.4, 3
7005, 3.5, 2/3218.5, 4
12000, 1.5, 2/5512.9, 5

Single-band compressor:
Threshold: -18dB
Ratio: 3x:1
Attack: 10ms
Release: 100ms

Hard Limiter (Peak):
Max Amplitude: -1 dB
Look-ahead Time: 7ms
Release time: 100ms

- [x] Local notifications on both desktop/mobile implementation is a bit weird and too much in terms of showing itself. For example, on the phone, when you're not looking into a specific server channel chat but you're in DMs, and then you enter that server channel chat - it shows the local notification card above. This and the entire system needs to be investigated in order ot be useful and fix such bugs (proper UX little audit with it)
- [x] Add Verify a Proof (desktop thing from Settings->Security tab) to mobile in same tab; rename "Export account & verify proofs" to "Export identity" in Archive card + find all instances of "account" words and rename them to "identity"; remove Push Diagnostics completely from mobile (currently seen on iOS UI) and strip any sensitive logging on both desktop/mobile (messages etc.)

- [x] Fix blinking avatar during active call on mobile (in the call sheet, only my OWN avatar blinks when speaking, VAD works correctly but this blinking is weird as if it's reloads it every time or something); make the call sheet movable; we recently did like Rust threading optimization and now I wonder if it was actually good or there is something that could be optimized further not only during WebRTC stuff like data channels or calls, but most importantly - in the app logic itself. Everything has to be fully optimized
  - Done 2026-07-03: avatar blink = SpeakingBorder Semantics remount (fixed, tree-stable); call sheet drag-to-minimize (MobileSheetDragToMinimize, route-controller driven); 3-agent perf audit (verdict on threading work: SOUND) + full fix pass implemented — see reports/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_2026_07.md. Also: legacy HTTP signaling retired (WS discover_peers is primary) and TURN credentials moved to the authed WS (fixes the silent STUN-only degradation + unauthenticated credential endpoint).

- [x] Fix multiple screens stacking on top of each other when you press on the inside-app notification; fix DM push notifications of Android (iOS fully works, no need for it); previous commit with "DECRYPT OK" in debug - I think the UI needs fixing because it doesn't update itself when the messages flow fast (I was spamming fast and the UI didn't udpate properly on desktop and no idea if it's when I transitioned to the chat or something else)
  - Done 2026-07-03: notification taps pop-then-push (routeName-tagged chat routes, guarded selection cleanups); Android DM+channel push nudge the LIVE node (the full-node guard made every backgrounded push a placeholder); fast-flow staleness was a stack of real bugs — identical-text same-ms dedup DROPPED distinct messages (DM+channel, partial legacy index + mid checks), sync-batch races suppressed live events (duplicate-aware receive events), subscribe holes (mobile Chats-tab never subscribed, desktop subscribed under the OLD server, reconnect never re-subscribed topics). Chat lists rebuilt reverse:true (newest=index 0, instant jumpTo only, freeze-while-reading); sync watermark gaps healed via 30-min lookback + reconcile hardening; ghost unread fixed (ms-granular seen comparison + gated recompute).

- [x] Fix the constant blinking on every new message in chat; fix second_debug.log crash.
  - Done 2026-07-03: blink = full-row remount on every arrival (reverse-list index shift + message-keyed rows + no key-based slot matching in scrollable_positioned_list) — vendored the package with a findChildIndexCallback patch so elements MOVE across slots; guard test `chat_list_element_reuse_test.dart`. Crashes: data-channel close order in the flutter_webrtc fork (cancel subscription before closing controllers) + "Node is not running" = un-awaited node-requiring FFI calls escaping sync try/catch (subscribeChannels → retry helper `channel_topic_service.dart`; registerPushToken, joinRoom-on-resume, requestPublicChannels & friends → .catchError).

- [X] Get Linux out of Experimental phase, please
  - [x] **Linux screen-share audio anti-echo + per-app capture.** Done 2026-07-04 (same day as the v1 monitor capture): `PulseSinkInputCapturer` — per-sink-input capture via `pa_stream_set_monitor_stream` with dynamic subscribe (the PA analog of Windows `MultiProcessCapturer`). Entire-screen EXCLUDES Hollow's process tree (echo gone, 2-machine confirmed); window shares INCLUDE only the shared app's tree via X id → `_NET_WM_PID` (silence on no match, never the system mix). Key quirk: native PipeWire clients carry their pid on the CLIENT object (`pipewire.sec.pid`), not the stream proplist — resolved via an async client-info hop. See memory `project_linux_screen_audio`.

- [x] **IPv6 support (relay + TURN/STUN + verify ICE).** Done 2026-07-05 server-side: uWS was already dual-stack on `[::]:443` (zero relay listener changes); coturn un-pinned from `0.0.0.0` (listens all system IPs both families; redundant `external-ip` dropped — public v4 is on-interface, no NAT) — STUN binding + authed TURN allocation verified over v4 AND v6; AAAA `relay.anonlisten.com → 2001:41d0:ab01::4:0:d` published via Hostinger (OVH DHCPv6-assigned stable address). Relay per-IP limits now aggregate v6 by /64 (`ip_limit_key` in ws_handler.cpp) with v4-MAPPED unmapping — CRITICAL: uWS reports v4 clients on the dual-stack listener as v4-mapped v6 hex; truncating those to /64 would collapse ALL v4 users into one bucket (caught + fixed same session). Client code confirmed family-agnostic (no candidate filtering; libwebrtc gathers v6 on its own). REMAINING: end-to-end ICE test from a v6-capable peer (mobile hotspot — home ISP has no v6). See memory `project_relay_ipv6`.
  - OVH VPS ships free IPv6 — add an AAAA record for `relay.anonlisten.com`, make the relay (uWS) listen on `::`, add coturn v6 listening/relay IPs, and verify libwebrtc gathers v6 ICE candidates end-to-end (it does automatically once the OS has v6 — zero client code expected). Payoff: v6↔v6 peer pairs have no NAT, so ICE goes direct where v4 hits symmetric NAT/CGNAT → fewer TURN-relayed calls, more gossip-tree data channels, more Hollow Share successes (biggest win on mobile carriers, which are v6-native behind CGNAT). Only helps when BOTH peers have v6 (~50% adoption, growing) — an optimization, not a scaling pillar. Test with a v6-capable peer (mobile hotspot works; home ISP may not offer v6 at all).
- [x] **Relay volume fairness without quotas (2026-08-28).** The 10 GB/day per-IP byte budget below was REMOVED end to end (relay counting + `get_bandwidth`, Rust `request_relay_bandwidth`/`BandwidthStatus`/`BandwidthLimited`, Dart `relayBandwidthProvider` + `DailyUsageMeter` + both relay cards). It counted every WS frame (share audio over `0x03`, sync, asset pulls) yet never touched TURN, which is a separate process. Replaced by two levers that need no notion of a "genuine" user (unverifiable: the client is open source and identities are free): (1) **coturn peer lock**: `denied-peer-ip` = everything, `allowed-peer-ip` = the relay host's own v4 + v6 addresses, `no-tcp-relay`; TURN can only carry Hollow client to Hollow client (relay<->relay ICE pair, same bytes as relay<->srflx), verified with `turnutils_uclient` (external peer 403 Forbidden IP, relay-to-relay 20/20, TCP relay 442). (2) **CAKE on the VPS NIC**: `tc qdisc replace dev ens16 root cake bandwidth 950mbit besteffort dual-dsthost`, persisted as `hollow-cake.service`; per-destination-host fair share only under saturation, nothing counted. See memory `project_relay_fairshare_turn_lock`.
  - SUPERSEDED (kept for history): **Relay per-IP daily byte budget (anti-drain backstop, 10 GB/day).** Done 2026-07-05, deployed + live-verified (guest WS test: 100 KB frame counted exactly). Relay: `bytes_today`/`budget_day` on `IpState` (keyed by `ip_limit_key` — v4 addr / v6 /64), cached `IpState*` on PerSocketData (zero-lookup per frame), counts BINARY both directions (inbound `.message` + outbound `send_to_peer`, attributed to the RECIPIENT so download-drains count), lazy UTC-day rollover, enforcement = explicit `1008 "bandwidth_limit"` at inbound binary AND text entry, entries with bytes survive disconnect, stale-day purge on the 300s sweep. `get_bandwidth` WS command → `bandwidth_status`; client `request_relay_bandwidth()` FFI → `NetworkEvent::BandwidthStatus`; "Daily Relay Data" meter in the desktop Home relay card and the mobile Settings relay card.
  - Original spec: The 34 MB file limit is client-side only — an authenticated connection has ZERO relay-side byte accounting, so a modified client can stream unlimited 256 KB frames through the relay (see memory `project_relay_bandwidth_enforcement`). Fix: count bytes per IP in the existing in-RAM `ip_states` (never logged, same privacy model as the connection caps; per-IP not per-connection so reconnects don't reset it). There's no industry "norm" — the right number is a generous multiple of organic use, and organic relay use is tiny (text/signaling/CRDT + the WS file-fallback tail; files ride the gossip tree, media rides P2P/TURN) — 10 GB/day is roughly 300× a heavy chatter's real relay traffic, so false positives ≈ 0 while capping a 24/7 drain bot at ~10 GB instead of ~4 TB. Rules: (1) NEVER silently drop frames (the removed soft-limits killed transfers silently — `feedback_relay_rules`) — on budget exhaustion, close with an explicit reason (`bandwidth_limit`) so the client surfaces it; (2) IPv6 MUST aggregate by /64 prefix, not per-address (one host owns 2^64 addresses — per-address budgets are trivially bypassed); (3) fixed UTC-day window is fine; (4) counter covers binary frames both directions. Caveat: CGNAT/campus IPs share a budget across many users — if that ever bites, scale the budget by active connection count per IP before touching the number.

- [X] **Mobile screen share SEND (video + system audio, Android + iOS).** SHIPPED — DEVICE-VERIFIED BOTH PLATFORMS 2026-07-05 (Pixel 8 Pro + iPhone → Windows, music playback, backgrounded, 3+ min stable, "audio quality is AWESOME"). Implemented 2026-07-04 and hardened across 5 debug rounds, each with a distinct log-proven root cause: (1) desktop render exe had no jitter pre-buffer vs the phone's bursty cadence → 100ms prime + 40ms rebuffer-on-dry + latency ratcheting in shared `audio_player.h` (+ URGENT_AUDIO capture-thread priority); (2) debug APK = dev-profile Rust = unoptimized c2rust Opus couldn't encode MUSIC at realtime (silence encodes free — looked like a jitter bug) → `[profile.dev.package.unsafe-libopus] opt-level=3` + mobile complexity 5; (3) App Store validation rejects `RPBroadcastProcessMode` unless DIRECTLY under NSExtension (Xcode's own template verified; NSExtensionAttributes nesting reads as "not specified"); (4) audio messages interleaved on the broadcast video socket wedge the stock CFHTTPMessage parser permanently (exactly 4 packets then dead) → audio got its OWN app-group socket `rtc_SSFD_audio` with [u32le len][pcm] framing, video socket reverted byte-exact to the Jitsi/LiveKit reference; (5) the call's AVAudioSession lacked `MixWithOthers` → another app's music INTERRUPTED the session and iOS suspended the backgrounded app ~45s later, collapsing the call (not share-specific!) → flag added to all AudioUtils.m masks + libwebrtc's webRTCConfiguration template. Also restored the a114376-removed iOS diagnostics export as Settings > Identity Backup > "Export Debug Logs" (only zero-Mac way to pull iPhone logs). Full detail: memory `project_mobile_screen_share_send`. Phones can now share their screen WITH device audio into DM calls and voice channels, riding the exact desktop pipeline: same `screen_offer`/`screen_state` signaling, same per-peer ScreenShareService PCs, same pure-Opus `0x03` data-channel audio (never a WebRTC track — no AEC/AGC mangling). **Rust:** `encode_screen_audio` FFI in `api/screen_audio.rs` (unsafe-libopus encoder, 48k stereo s16le → 10 ms frames @ 128 kbps complexity 10, buffers uneven PCM chunks, emits `[seq:4 LE][opus]` wire packets; encode↔decode roundtrip unit test green). **Android:** fork gained `ScreenCaptureForegroundService` (mediaProjection-typed FGS — API 29+ hard requirement before `getMediaProjection`; starts via continuation before capture, dies with the capturer) + `ScreenShareAudioCapturer` (AudioPlaybackCapture riding the SAME MediaProjection as video — Android 14 forbids a second projection; MEDIA/GAME/UNKNOWN usages, mic path untouched so the user talks over the share) streaming PCM over a new Android `FlutterWebRTC/ScreenShareAudio` EventChannel (same contract as macOS SCK). Anti-echo = `android:allowAudioPlaybackCapture="false"` on Hollow's own manifest (own playback never re-captured; uid-exclude can't be mixed with usage matching). Plugin Java compiles green. **iOS:** ReplayKit Broadcast Upload Extension (`ios/BroadcastExtension/` — SampleHandler/SampleUploader/BroadcastSocketConnection/BroadcastAudioConverter Swift target hand-added to pbxproj mirroring the NSE's fileSystemSynchronized structure, bundle id `com.anonlisten.hollow.BroadcastExtension`, App Group `group.com.anonlisten.hollow` reused); video = downscaled JPEG over the fork's app-group unix socket (CFHTTPMessage framing, ~15 fps cap for the 50 MB extension ceiling), audio = `.audioApp` buffers AVAudioConverter-resampled to 48k stereo s16 and interleaved on the SAME socket with a `Buffer-Audio: 1` header (fork's frame reader + FlutterBroadcastScreenCapturer extended; plugin forwards onto the now-cross-platform ScreenShareAudio EventChannel). `RTCScreenSharingExtension`/`RTCAppGroupIdentifier` added to Runner Info.plist; `getDisplayMedia` deviceId `'broadcast'` selects the picker. **Dart:** `MobileScreenAudioCapturer` (PCM EventChannel → Rust encode → `sendScreenAudio`, ordered serial chain + backlog drop), mobile branches in ScreenShareService/providers, VC uses ONE central capturer fanning to all share peers (Rust encoder is process-global — desktop's per-peer-exe pattern would double-encode), share buttons + pre-share bottom sheet (audio toggle, DRM/`ALLOW_CAPTURE_BY_NONE` note) on the mobile DM call screen + VC route; no self-preview on mobile (sharing your own screen = mirror recursion; avatar view + accent button convey state). Known v1 gaps: stopping from the OS surface (Android cast tile / iOS control center) isn't detected as share-end; iOS share sits black until the user taps Start Broadcast. See memory `project_mobile_screen_share_send`, `tmp_nextSession.txt` for the device-test checklist.
  - [x] Can't hear what Android mic says during screen sharing and even when you stop playing music, the mic is still like completely shut off (but it's not muted!) and only when you switch back to the app, the mic suddenly heals and it works. Needs fixing.
    - Fixed 2026-07-17 (awaiting device pass): same single root cause as the item below — during a share you're backgrounded BY DEFINITION (you're in the app you're sharing), so the mic died every time; stopping the music changed nothing because music was never the cause. The mediaProjection FGS keeps capture+share audio alive but does NOT cover the mic.
  - [x] The WebRTC audio quality is finally fixed and it was the built-in AGC fighting with our custom one. Another bug I found - the audio gets killed on Android if you background the app and keep talking for like 5 seconds. Wait a second, isn't it the same thing as I wrote above? Maybe it is, no idea. But ok, will look into it later.
    - Fixed 2026-07-17 (awaiting device pass): YES — same bug. Android 11+ feeds a backgrounded app's mic AudioRecord SILENCE (a few seconds of grace, then nothing) unless a microphone-typed foreground service is running, and Hollow had NONE (the only FGS was ScreenCaptureForegroundService, mediaProjection-typed, share-only; plain calls had no FGS at all). Foregrounding "healed" the mic because the OS auto-resumes real audio for foreground apps — no app code was involved. Fix in the fork: new `CallForegroundService` (`foregroundServiceType="microphone"` + FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE permission, low-importance "Ongoing call" notification that taps back into the app) started/stopped from `AudioSwitchManager.start()/stop()` — i.e. mic acquisition ↔ call teardown — covering DM calls, VCs and conferences with zero Dart changes, and always started while foregrounded (the API 34 legality rule; failures degrade gracefully to today's behavior). iOS never had the bug (`UIBackgroundModes: audio` + the broadcast extension is its own process — device-proven by the backgrounded iPhone share test). See memory `project_android_background_mic_fgs`.
  - [x] **Screen-share audio loudness package (2026-07-17, awaiting device pass):** share audio played RAW at unity end-to-end while the voice chain converges at ~−16 LUFS, so mastered content (−14 LUFS or hotter, far denser than speech) drowned voices. Receiver-side fix, zero wire changes, the sender's pristine stream untouched: (1) ramped playback gain in BOTH decode sinks — Rust `decode_screen_audio` (mobile; `set_screen_audio_gain` FFI, unit-tested scale + ramp) and the desktop render exe (control frame on the existing stdin pipe: sentinel seq 0xFFFFFFFF, cmd 0x01, f32 gain; envelope τ≈30 ms down / τ≈300 ms up, duplicated in both sinks — keep in sync); (2) `ShareAudioLevel` bus fusing the persisted share-volume slider (0–200%, 100% = −6 dB calibration, 200% = original source loudness — gain never exceeds unity so it can't clip), MV6-style voice-activity ducking (−10 dB while ANYONE speaks, self included, off the existing 200 ms VAD callbacks with a 400 ms hold; default ON), and deafen — which previously did NOT silence share audio (only voice tracks); (3) `ShareVolumeButton` on all four share surfaces (DM overlay pill + VC controls pill on desktop; both mobile call top bars → bottom sheet) with the slider + "Quieter when people talk" toggle. Sender-side ducking (the Shure MV6 model) was considered and rejected: the sharer's mic only hears the SHARER, and it would bake the duck into the stream for every receiver. Deliberately NO loudness normalization of share content (movies/games keep their dynamics). Windows exe rebuilt; macOS/Linux pick the render change up on their next exe rebuild. See memory `project_share_audio_loudness_ducking`.
  - [x] **Voice buried after a mute cycle while sharing music (device test 2026-07-17, fixed same day, awaiting re-test):** repro — desktop shares with music on speakers, mutes while the other side talks, unmutes, talks → receiver barely hears the voice under the share audio. Root cause: the Voice Enhancement DYNAMIC SERVO keeps adapting while muted — WebRTC mute is `track.enabled=false` which zeroes the OUTBOUND frames but the APM capture path (where our post-processor runs) keeps seeing real mic input; speaker music bleed passes the servo's −55 dBFS speech floor, so during the muted stretch the servo slams the input trim down (9 dB/s slew, −20 dB range) calibrated to MUSIC, and on unmute the voice comes out buried and recovers at only +3 dB/s while the ongoing bleed holds the meter up. Fix: new `setCaptureMuted` plumbed Dart→all 3 native ports (`Helper.setCaptureMuted` → `SetMuted`/`setMuted` on the C++/darwin/Java CaptureGainProcessors, kept verbatim-in-sync) — the servo's meter/trim update is FROZEN while muted (chain otherwise unchanged); called from DM `toggleMute`, VC `setMuted`, both teardowns reset false. Discriminating check if it persists: repeat with headphones on the sharer — no bleed, no adaptation. See memory `feedback_capture_servo_mute_freeze`.
    - **The 13:1x "still present" retest was INVALID** (log-proven): Release binaries were rebuilt 13:11 but the desktop app session (started 12:41) was never restarted — one single "Node starting" in the log; a running process keeps executing the DLLs it loaded, so every retest ran PRE-fix code. Meanwhile the duck was confirmed live in the same log (render exe "Gain target 0.500 → 0.158 → 0.500"). ALSO closed the second hole the analysis exposed: mute-freeze only covers the muted window — with music playing, the servo re-adapts down at 9 dB/s during any UNMUTED non-speech gap. New `setCaptureServoHold` (same 3-port plumbing): servo freezes for the entire time share audio is ACTIVE on the device — sending a share with audio (both providers' start/stop/teardown) OR playing a received one (ShareAudioLevel attach/detach) — holding the pre-share speech calibration.
  - [x] **Android stop-share FREEZE (3 identical ANRs 2026-07-17, root-caused from DropBox traces, fixed same day):** pressing stop-share (and hang-up after) froze the app. AB-BA deadlock in the fork's `OrientationAwareScreenCapturer`: synchronized `stopCapture` holds the capturer monitor while awaiting the texture thread, while the texture thread's `onFrame` enters synchronized `changeCaptureFormat` on EVERY frame → both wait forever ("Input dispatching timed out"). Fix: `stopCapture` un-synchronized + volatile `stopping` flag; `onFrame` bails monitor-free during teardown (also replaces the checkNotDisposed throw for late frames). Diagnostic gold: `adb shell dumpsys dropbox --print data_app_anr` returns full ANR thread stacks WITHOUT root. The SFrame screen-noise + AL-side "call froze" were fallout of the deadlocked peer (AL's PC failed 4 s after the Pixel force-kill), not separate bugs. See memory `feedback_android_stopcapture_deadlock`.
  - [x] **RESOLVED — "output switch kills mic" / "double-talk silences one side" were SAME-ROOM TESTING ARTIFACTS (2026-07-17):** both devices in one room hear each other's speakers, so each AEC cancels the OTHER device live and moving between them modulates suppression — phantom "mic died" / "words fade at the end" effects. A real remote test (Vitalik ↔ brother) was fully clean on the final build: no output-switch issue, no double-talk issue, mic + share audio both directions "outstanding". The defensive input re-assert after output switches (voice_service, logs "Re-asserted audio input") stays — verified firing, harmless, and covers any genuine future ADM capture death. No Echo Cancellation toggle needed for now (revisit only on a REMOTE-peer repro). Iron rule: voice-quality bugs only count when reproduced with a genuinely remote peer.
  - [x] Add UPWARD compression to the Voice Enhancement chain (the missing ingredient the research flagged). Right now the chain is downward-only: it pulls loud parts down and makeup-gains everything up, so it hits -16 LUFS but soft/trailing speech (leaning back, mumbling, ends of words) still drops in level. Upward compression pushes the QUIET parts UP toward the loud ones, so the voice stays consistently present no matter how softly you talk. This is a big part of the RVox density we're still missing. THE CATCH: upward compression also lifts the noise floor and any residual echo/room tone between words, which is exactly what crackled in the reverted adaptive chains. So it MUST have a gate/downward-expander in front of it, and both should be AUTOMATIC inside dynamic mode (not user knobs) so flipping on Dynamic just works and only ever brings the positive outcome, never the noise. Two new stages (gate + upward comp), both auto-managed by the servo, harness-verified offline first (model the gate + upward stage, prove the floor stays controlled before any device build). See memory `project_voice_agc_loudness_rvox`.
    - Implemented 2026-07-17 (harness-verified offline; DEVICE-VERIFIED same day — "pure magic"): ONE fused stage between EQ and compressor, dynamic mode only, all 3 native ports in sync (C++/darwin/Java). Shared 1/25 ms envelope -> upward 3:1 toward the -15 dBFS speech envelope point (cap +8 dB) + soft 4:1 expander 17 dB below it (cap -14 dB); boost multiplied by TWO presence gates: SNR above a min-statistics floor tracker (2x750 ms window minima — "never lift the floor" encoded directly) and positive-only 3-8 Hz syllabic modulation (steady noise/tones get ZERO boost). Offline g++ harness (baseline-vs-new against the REAL .cc, speech-band gated noise + floor sweeps + tails + onsets + FFT purity) went through FOUR parametrizations, each killed by a measured failure: plain curve lifted -50 floors +7 dB (servo cranks gap noise into the boost zone); absolute-level presence killed tails (same envelope as a noisy mic's floor); rate-limited floor tracker lagged the servo 15 s. FINAL numbers vs baseline: normal speech transparent (-15.75 vs -15.79, peaks -1.0), quiet-floor gaps -12.7 dB, -50-floor gaps -3.4 dB, terrible -45-floor mic bit-identical (stage bows out), soft speech +1.6/+0.9, word tails +2.4, long-noise floor -1.6, steady-tone THD/spur bit-identical to baseline at every level (no zipper). Cold-start: detectors settle ~1.5 s after join (boost suppressed-then-released, smooth). WAVs + harness in scratchpad `upward/`. See memory `project_voice_upward_compression`.
    - Field fix same day (Razer BlackShark quiet-voice drop): the gate threshold was ABSOLUTE and ate quiet/intimate speech on WEAK mics whose servo trim clamps at +12 (level landscape sits ~7 dB low → quiet voice lands in the gate). Now floor-relative: `min(-32 absolute, tracked_floor + 10)`. Harness weak-mic scenario: quiet words were -44.7 dBFS out (13.9 dB gate cut) vs -32.2 baseline; fixed build -31.7 with boost instead of cut, +13 dB recovery, zero regression on every other metric (all 3 ports in sync).
  - [x] **De-esser (2026-07-17, harness-verified + device-verified same day).** Vitalik heard sibilance on the enhanced chain; raw-mic spectral analysis (`mic_test.wav`, Razer BlackShark) measured his esses at 6.3-6.9 kHz — exactly under the EQ's +3.5 dB 7 kHz presence peak, so the chain was brightening esses along with consonants. New stage in all 3 native ports, BOTH enhance modes, placed AFTER the compressor (pre-comp placement gave half the cut back via makeup — harness-measured), before the limiter: split v = lp + hf at a fixed 4.8 kHz lowpass (subtract-complement — reconstruction at zero cut is exact), duck ONLY hf up to 10 dB, keyed on the ratio of a TRUE 24 dB/oct highpass detector envelope to the fullband envelope (level-independent — weak mics de-ess correctly) times a -40 dBFS level gate. Two detector bugs the harness caught: (v-lp) as detector has a phase-mismatch skirt that reads midrange as HF; a single 12 dB/oct HP still false-triggered on bright content — two cascaded stages fixed it (speech-realistic vowels now -0.03 dB = transparent, ess bursts -7.7 dB, 7 kHz tone -10.7 dB, 500 Hz sines bit-identical). Same raw-capture analysis also confirmed the Razer facts: brickwall at 8 kHz (16k internal processing), very dark (-27 dB by 2.5-5k vs vowels), HF SNR ~5-10 dB (the perceived "distortion" = consonants near the hiss floor + NS chewing them — DFN3's job), speech RMS -34.6 dBFS raw (the weak-mic trim-clamp case), noise floor -87 (excellent). No clipping — "distortion" is NOT overload.
  - [~] **AI Noise Suppression via DeepFilterNet3 (start ONLY after upward compression ships).**
    - STATUS 2026-07-18: scaffold SHIPPED and field-proven end-to-end (toggle → engine → constraint flip → recapture → reneg → fallback all work), but **DFN has not yet denoised a live frame on any platform** — the capture hooks don't hand us 48 kHz fullband: Windows runs at 16 kHz mono (Razer is a 16k-class device; whole enhance chain has always run at 16 kHz there), Android at 48 kHz SPLIT-BAND 3×160 (ThreeBandFilterBank case is NOT Linux-only). REMAINING to go live: an adapter layer in hollow_dfn (ABI v2 `hollow_dfn_process_ex(buf, num_bands, band_len, rate, channels)`: 48k direct, 16k via 1:3 polyphase resample, split-band via band merge→denoise→re-split) — engine-independent work that ANY suppressor needs. OPEN DECISION: engine strategy — DFN3 (quality king: −22.6 dB on the noisy-twin test of Vitalik's own voice; but ~10 MB binary, 15 s model load on Pixel (pre-warm added), borderline phone CPU) vs RNNoise/nnnoiseless (pure-Rust MIT, instant init, ~1 MB, trivial CPU, clearly lower quality on hard noise) vs BOTH with per-platform defaults. LL model DISQUALIFIED (adds +12 dB artifacts in near-silent gaps). Ground truth from test.wav: Vitalik's quiet-room floor is −80..−90 dBFS — nothing to suppress between words on HIS setup; the feature's value is noise events + noisy-room users. Diagnosability now baked in: status maps carry frames/emaMs/rate/channels/bands/bufferSize, Dart logs them at every capture + reconcile — a voice feature field test is INVALID until the log proves frames>0. See memory `project_dfn3_noise_suppression`.

- [X] **Profile Showcase Board (IGDB game shelf + Steam-style composable blocks).** Turn the profile card into a wide dialog with an adaptive layout: center = the person as today (avatar/banner/name/bio/roles/connections); LEFT and RIGHT are optional "showcase boards" the user composes from block types (Now Playing, Favorite Game, Game Shelf/Collection, Artwork/GIF, Text/Markdown — Mutuals VETOED 2026-07-07: relational/shared-graph surfaces = Discovery-species privacy leak, never without explicit approval). The user chooses how many sides to fill — **fill neither → just the center card (today's behavior); fill right only → Discord-Board-style two-column; fill both → full three-column.** Games metadata (covers/genres) comes from IGDB via a write-through cache on the Hostinger CDN (client → website endpoint holding the single Twitch app Client ID/Secret → cache to CDN dir → serve everyone after; ~1 IGDB call per game ever, trivially under the 4 req/s cap; on-demand only, never pre-scrape their DB = ToS-safe). All board data is self-curated (NO auto process-detection — "Now Playing" is manually set), rides the existing ProfileUpdate/Profile-blob replication like avatars/banners, so display is P2P with zero IGDB/website call. Markdown block is SANITIZED (images restricted to already-uploaded/cached blobs — a raw `![](tracker)` would break "receivers never phone home"). Give everyone all blocks day one (NO Steam-style level-gating). Multi-session epic. See `reports/PROFILE_SHOWCASE_BOARD.md`.
  - [x] **Phase 1 — profile UI shell (2026-07-07, awaiting visual pass):** shared `ProfileCardBody` with compact/full densities (`components/profile_card_body.dart`) so popup and dialog can never drift; popup reworked to compact density (left-aligned identity header, role+labels merged into ONE chip row, presence row added, Transform hacks removed, width 280→300, banner 104px matching the dialog's aspect) with a banner expand affordance; Twitch chip promoted to the integrations corner — top-right under the banner at BOTH densities (rightmost element of the dialog's action band); new full `ProfileDialog` (`dialogs/profile_dialog.dart`, 460px center, 160px hero banner, action band right of avatar) — the future host for showcase board columns; mobile routes to the existing bottom sheet for parity. `showLocalNicknameDialog` moved to the body file (re-exported from `profile_card_popup.dart`).
  - [x] **Phase 2 — board replication + Text block + composer (2026-07-07, awaiting visual pass):** new `showcase_board` profile field end-to-end (SQLCipher column via the twitch_username migration pattern; `save_profile` COALESCE semantics None=preserve/""=clear; BOTH wire ProfileUpdate enums carry `Option<String>` with `#[serde(default)]` — None from old clients PRESERVES the stored board, so a status edit from an old client can't wipe it; rides the LIGHT announce since it's capped text, 16KB receive backstop treats oversized as absent; `update_profile` FFI + codegen). Harness test `showcase_board_replicates_preserves_and_clears` green (replicates master-keyed, survives board-untouched updates, explicit clear propagates); full Rust suite 396 passing. Dart: `ShowcaseBoard` model (`models/showcase_board.dart`, unknown block types round-trip so old clients can't destroy newer blocks), Text block rendered via the chat `MessageText` parser (sanitized by construction — no fetches, links open only on tap), `ShowcaseBoardColumn` display, `showcase_editor.dart` composer (per-side add/edit/remove + drag reorder, 4 blocks/side, 8KB cap), boards = SEPARATE flanking panels beside the self-contained center card (270px, IntrinsicHeight-stretched to read as the card's wings — Vitalik's corrected layout, NOT columns inside the card; stacked-below fallback on narrow windows), integrations chip on its own corner line above the action buttons + breathing-room spacing pass, compact popup gets a "View showcase" hint, mobile sheet renders boards stacked + Edit Showcase (sheet now scrolls). **Mutuals block VETOED mid-phase** (see block-type list above; memory `feedback_no_relational_profile_blocks`). Layout corrected twice per Vitalik's visual passes: (a) boards = separate flanking panels, not columns inside the card; (b) scaled up (card 560, banner 220, avatar 110, panels 340, ensemble minHeight 560) + action buttons moved to ONE ROW below About Me (corner band = Twitch chip alone, both densities).
  - [x] **Phase 3 — IGDB game blocks + Artwork + asset replication (2026-07-07, awaiting endpoint upload + visual pass):** `showcase_assets` blob column rides the FULL avatar/banner playbook (COALESCE/CLEAR semantics, hash on light announce, pull via extended `maybe_request_full_profile`, 2MB wire cap, 1.5MB authoring cap); bundle = JSON hash→b64, content-addressed — `decode_asset_bundle` DROPS any entry whose bytes don't match their hash (integrity check, unit-tested). New `api/showcase.rs`: `showcase_game_search` (website endpoint), `showcase_fetch_cover` (REFUSES non-Hollow-CDN URLs — never a generic fetcher), `process_showcase_artwork` (GIF→animated WebP 600KB / stills 800px WebP 400KB), `get_showcase_assets`. Harness test extended: bundle replicates byte-exact + survives untouched updates + clears. Website endpoint `!hollow-website/igdb/search.php` (WholesomeStoryAday repo): Twitch client_credentials token cached to token.json, IGDB search, write-through cover cache to `covers/` (~1 IGDB call per game ever), config.php gitignored (+.htaccess denies config/token) — NEEDS MANUAL UPLOAD to `/public_html/hollow/igdb/`. Dart: 4 new block types (Now Playing / Favorite Game / Game Shelf / Artwork) with renderers off `showcaseAssetsProvider` (invalidated on ProfileUpdated), block picker, debounced game-search dialog ("Game data from IGDB" attribution), shelf editor, artwork via FilePicker→Rust processing; save prunes the bundle to board-referenced hashes. Display remains pure P2P — viewers never touch IGDB/website.
  - [x] **Phase 3 polish round (2026-07-07, post-first-run):** (1) dialog SCALES columns proportionally on narrow windows (scale = (available−gaps)/columnsWidth, side-by-side down to 0.62× before stacking — the 1280px window keeps 3 panels); (2) EVERY block type edits in place with its own dialog (game re-pick, blurb/caption prompts prefilled, shelf editor prefills label+games; artwork edit = caption only, image replace = remove+add); (3) game-type tag chip in search results (IGDB `category` → "Main Game"/"Mod"/"DLC"/"Update"/… mapped server-side, `game_type` on GameSearchResult); (4) endpoint gained a SQLite `games.db` write-through cache (games + searches tables, 30-day search TTL, WAL) — repeat searches are served ENTIRELY from our DB with zero IGDB traffic; genres/rating/summary cached too for future blocks; games.db denied by .htaccess + gitignored; (5) GIF fast-forward bug fixed in `AnimatedGifImage._onTick`: TickerMode mutes the ticker under a pushed dialog while `elapsed` accrues — on resume the schedule resyncs to now instead of catching up frame-per-tick (applies to banners + artwork).

- [X] **Saved messages (2026-07-07, awaiting visual pass):** a DM with your OWN master identity riding the whole existing DM pipeline (sibling fan-out, files count in Storage, search free). Rust short-circuits: `fan_out_dm_envelope` skips the recipient branch on self (no dead bare-master queue entries), `finish_send_file` skips the bare-master fallback + offline-push loop on self. UI: bookmark button in FriendsBar left of Help (opens via the standard `_selectFriend` batch), self-mode headers (bookmark avatar, "Saved messages", no presence/call buttons) in ChatPane + MobileChatRoute, pinned rows in Classic sidebar DM section + mobile Chats tab + both archive lists. Harness: `self_dm_saved_messages_stores_locally_and_replicates_to_sibling`. See memory `project_saved_messages_block_report`.
- [X] **Block/report ability (2026-07-07, awaiting visual pass + live report test):** Block = local, MASTER-keyed (SQLCipher `blocked_peers` + process-global `node/blocklist.rs` warmed at startup), enforced at Rust ingest — friend requests, live DMs, DM sync batches, DM FileHeaders, CallInvite/RtcOffer, offline fetch replay all drop before store+emit; channel messages stay stored but hidden in UI (unblock restores), channel unread/notifications suppressed in Dart (incl. notification hints). Report = relay-side counts: WS `report` command (spam/harassment/illegal_content/impersonation), one per (reporter,target,category) deduped via SHA-256 hashed keys — reporter ids never on disk; `reports.json` on the VPS (5-min dirty flush + shutdown save, `--reports-file` flag). RELAY DEPLOYED 2026-07-07. UI: Block/Report on profile card+popup+mobile sheet, Blocked Users management in Settings Security + mobile settings. Harness: `blocked_peer_dm_and_friend_request_dropped`. See memory `project_saved_messages_block_report`.
- [X] **Pill switching for mobile between screen and camera during calls (2026-07-10, awaiting device pass):** shared `MobileSourceSwitchPill` (`mobile/mobile_source_switch_pill.dart`, horizontal-scroll port of the desktop switchers) overlaid top-center on both mobile call surfaces when 2+ sources are active. DM (`mobile_call_video_view.dart`): big-tile resolution now honors `focusedDmSourceProvider` (the same provider desktop writes) with the old remote-screen > remote-cam > local-cam priority as fallback; pill shows for any 2+ sources. VC (`mobile_voice_channel_route.dart`): pill only in mixed mode (a remote share is up — a camera-only grid already shows every camera), taps go through `setFocusedSource`, and a focused CAMERA now renders full-bleed (branch 1) with the screen fallback validated against `peerScreenSharing` (focus may point at a camera peer); `_hasVideo` checks `peerScreenSharing` directly. Local SCREEN shares are never offered as tabs on mobile (no self-preview — infinite mirror).
- [X] **Image/file loading for the mobile — instant appearing (2026-07-10, awaiting device pass):** NOT a phone limitation — desktop optimistically inserted the bubble from the picker's local path BEFORE the network send (`chat_pane._sendStagedFile`), mobile called raw `network_api.sendFile` and waited for the FileCompleted→DB-reload round-trip. `mobile_chat_route._handleSend` + `_stageVoiceMessage` now do the same `addFileMessage` optimistic insert (DM + channel branches) and route through `fileTransferProvider.sendFile` — which also gains mobile the transfer progress state, video thumbnail pre-extraction, and >34 MB share-backed routing it was silently skipping. Bonus: chat image bubbles decode at display size (`cacheWidth`, ResizeImage never upscales; fullscreen still decodes full-res) — kills the full-res decode beat on phones.

- [X] **Real-time device switching during active call (2026-07-10, awaiting device test):** mic/camera/speaker picker changes in Settings now apply LIVE to active DM calls and voice channels. Services grew `setAudioInputDevice`/`setCameraDevice`/`setAudioOutputDevice` (voice_service.dart + voice_channel_service.dart): capture the NEW device first (failure keeps the old mic/camera working), swap senders via removeTrack+addTrack (never replaceTrack), preserve mute state, re-assert capture gain/enhance, re-bind SFrame per peer — `FrameCryptorService.disableSender` added because `enableForSender` is idempotent per (peer,kind) and would silently keep the cryptor on the removed sender — then renegotiate (DM: through the `_renegotiationInProgress` glare guard like toggleVideo; VC: per-PC `_sendRenegotiationOffer`, non-stable PCs queue via `_pendingCameraReneg`). VC mic switch also restarts the local VAD recorder (it holds its own device handle). Camera switch is a NO-OP on Linux (V4L2 open-once rule — applies next call). Providers `ref.listen` the three device providers (call_provider next to the mic-gain listeners; voice_channel_provider wired ONCE via `_deviceListenersWired` — the join path stacks listeners) with prev==next guards + `_captured*DeviceId` dedup in the services. **Round 2 (same day, Pixel log via adb run-as):** first field test gave ciphertext GIBBERISH on the receiving side — the sender rebind worked, but the swap lands on the REMOTE peer as a brand-new audio transceiver (mid:2, mid:3… per switch) and `enableForReceiver` is idempotent per (peer,kind), so the decryptor stayed on the dead receiver and the new track played raw SFrame bytes. Fix: `FrameCryptorService.disableReceiver` + both onTrack audio handlers now REBIND (drop-then-enable on `event.receiver`; fallback picks the NEWEST audio receiver — dead transceivers come first); VC `_enableSframeReceiver`'s walk also newest-wins. Iron rule: ANY renegotiation that replaces a sender needs BOTH sides re-bound — sender cryptor at the swap site, receiver cryptor in onTrack.
- [X] **Custom emotes + FFZ integration + emoji system redesign (2026-07-10, awaiting ffz/ endpoint upload + visual pass):** every custom emote is a content-addressed lossy-WebP blob (SHA-256; stills ≤64px/32KB Q90, animated GIF→animated WebP ≤256KB, animated-WebP passthrough under cap) — FFZ is an AUTHORING-TIME catalog only, proxied through OUR website (`ffz/search.php`, write-through SQLite + image cache, 429 Retry-After backoff; unauthenticated FFZ = 120 pts/min shared bucket → cache is mandatory); receivers NEVER make HTTP requests for emotes. Wire token `[e:name:hash]` (name 2-24 [a-z0-9_], full 64-hex hash; old clients render the raw token as text); reactions accept tokens via `valid_reaction_emoji` choke point. Server emote sets ride the CRDT (`EmojiAdded`/`EmojiRemoved`, `ServerState.emotes` #[serde(default)], cap 50, new `Permission::MANAGE_EMOTES` 1<<7 Admin+ default + roles-tab toggle); bytes replicate pull-based (`EmoteRequest`/`EmoteAssets` bundle, hash+WebP-magic+size verified at receive, once-per-connection throttle, DM→sender devices via send_raw_to_identity / channel→one room member); personal (global) emotes = local `personal_emotes` + same pull path, work in every chat with `:name:` text fallback while sender offline. Dart: unified `EmojiPickerBody` (1,907 vendored Unicode emojis w/ search + persisted recents, Server/Mine/FFZ tabs; FFZ tap = import→personal→insert), composer emoji buttons (desktop DM+channel, mobile sheet), mobile reaction sheet upgraded to full picker, `EmoteScope` pull-context on all 3 chat surfaces, parser `customEmote` WidgetSpan, reaction pills render emote images, server settings Emotes tab. BONUS HARDENING: `parse_ops_tolerant` at all 3 CRDT sync-batch sites — an unknown payload variant from a newer client now skips just that op instead of poisoning the whole batch (was: any future variant wedged older clients' server sync forever). Harness: `server_emote_replicates_and_bytes_pull_on_demand`. Also done: `:` shortcode autocomplete in composers (mention-overlay pattern is the template); mobile server-emote management UI. Later FOLLOW-UP: stickers (same mechanism, bigger caps, standalone render).
- [X] **Camera front/back switching on mobile (2026-07-11, awaiting device pass):** flip button on BOTH mobile call surfaces — VC already had one; DM call screen (`mobile_call_video_view.dart`) gained the same conditional 7th button (shown while camera on, active calls only). Correctness pass under it: both services' `switchCamera()` now take the new facing from `Helper.switchCamera`'s return value (true = front) instead of blind-toggling (devices with >2 cameras drift), exposed as `isFrontCamera` on CallState + VoiceChannelState (reset to front on clearCurrent/call end, synced on camera enable); every LOCAL preview on both mobile surfaces mirrors only when front-facing (a mirrored back camera shows text reversed — previously hardcoded `mirror: true`); VC capture gained the `facingMode` fallback the DM service already had, so a re-enabled camera reopens on the last-used side. Double-side simultaneous camera DROPPED (iOS AVCaptureMultiCamSession + spotty Android concurrent-camera + custom native compositing in the fork = high effort, niche payoff — nobody wants it).
- [X] **Deep linking / URL protocol handler + web invite links (2026-07-11, awaiting device passes on all platforms + website upload):** `hollow://` scheme registered on ALL 6 platforms — Windows (Inno `[Registry]` HKCU + runtime reg.exe self-heal each launch covering portable-zip/dev/moved installs; `SendAppLinkToInstance` in main.cpp forwards a second launch's link to the running instance BEFORE the Dart PID lock can eat it), macOS + iOS (CFBundleURLTypes), Linux (`.desktop` `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/hollow;` + `Exec=… %u` in repo/flatpak/runtime-installed copies — runtime installer now REWRITES a stale .desktop instead of skip-if-exists, then `update-desktop-database` + `xdg-mime default`; my_application.cc: `G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE|HANDLES_OPEN` replaces NON_UNIQUE, `local_command_line` returns FALSE, activate presents the existing window), Android (VIEW/BROWSABLE intent-filter). Dart: `app_links` ^7.2.1 → `DeepLinkService` (core/services) inits pre-runApp, buffers links until HollowShell's post-frame `notifyShellReady()`, restores the tray-hidden window, then routes: server invite → confirm dialog → `joinServer`; room → confirm → roomProvider; share → `PasteLinkDialog(initialLink)`; recovery → `showJoinRecoveryPoolDialog(prefillLink)`. **Web invite form** `https://hollow.anonlisten.com/join#server=ID` (FRAGMENT — the id never reaches the server or its logs, no discovery surface): static SvelteKit `/join` route (in `!hollow-website`, built, needs manual Hostinger upload) auto-bounces to `hollow://` + Open-Hollow retry button + OS-detected download fallback, noindex. In-app "Invite" now copies the web form (`webServerInviteLink`); `classifyHollowLink` normalizes both forms so chat cards render the https form as the same Join card (old clients degrade to a clickable https link → browser → redirect — still works). New: recovery links render in-chat cards (previously paste-only). Unit tests `test/hollow_link_utils_test.dart`. Universal links / Android App Links (https:// opens app directly, no browser hop) = later follow-up: needs `apple-app-site-association` + `assetlinks.json` on the domain + associated-domains entitlement.

- [x] **Channel file fetch reroutes to an ONLINE holder (fixed 2026-07-16, awaiting live pass):** peer A sends an image, B (online) receives it, A goes offline, C comes online — C's request only ever targeted A (the original sender) and Rust silently dropped it ("No online device"). Fix at the Rust choke point: `handle_request_file` now falls back for CHANNEL files (full replication) to ONE online device of another server member (`channel_fallback_holder` in file_handler.rs — DM scope-guarded, single-pick preserving the one-stream/one-AES-key invariant; the responder already serves any file it holds on disk). Dart viewport sweep (`requestVisibleFiles`) now orders candidates sender-first-then-online-server-members instead of arbitrary global peers, and skips WITHOUT throttling when nobody's online so later passes retry; dead `_requestMissingFiles` deleted. BONUS FIELD BUG: `online_devices_for` unconditionally stripped the bare master from its result — which only ever fires for LEGACY device==master identities, so channel byte replication NEVER streamed to legacy members (fresh installs are device≠master, masking it); now the master is kept when it IS a live room socket. Harness: `channel_file_request_reroutes_to_online_holder_when_sender_offline` (also covers the legacy-holder shape).

- [x] **Tablets + landscape showing the desktop shell (fixed 2026-07-16, awaiting device pass):** `HollowShell` picked the layout purely by width, so tablets and landscape phones crossed the 600px breakpoint into the desktop UI. Now Android/iOS ALWAYS get `MobileShell` regardless of width, and rotation is locked to portrait everywhere it can be: `SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([portraitUp])` in main.dart, `android:screenOrientation="portrait"` on MainActivity, Info.plist portrait-only for iPhone AND iPad + `UIRequiresFullScreen` (iPadOS ignores orientation locks for multitasking-capable apps without it). `mobile_image_crop_route` dispose no longer restores ALL orientations (would have silently unlocked rotation for the rest of the session). DEFERRED edge cases: proper landscape/tablet-optimized mobile layouts, and the scattered `width < 600` checks (toast offset, welcome dialog compact) that still read as "desktop" on portrait tablets ≥600px wide — revisit when unlocking rotation.
- [x] **Twitch toggle broken for Admins + Save button vanishing on toggle-OFF (fixed 2026-07-16, awaiting visual pass):** two real defects. (1) Permission mismatch: the UI gated server settings (incl. Twitch) on the `MANAGE_SERVER` permission bit, but default Admin permissions didn't include it (only Owner's ALL did) — a stock Admin saw a hidden section / dead toggle. Worse, Rust gated `ServerSettingChanged` by ROLE (`OwnerOrAdmin`) while `handle_rename_server` and the UI gated by PERMISSION, so an override-granted Moderator could author a rename the entire network rejected (author-side fork — exactly the divergence the `op_allowed` doc warns about). Fix: `ServerSettingChanged`/`ServerRenamed` now gate on `Permission::MANAGE_SERVER` (override-aware) at BOTH author (`handle_update_server_setting`, `OpGate::Perm`) and ingest (`op_allowed`), and Admin's `default_permissions()` now includes `MANAGE_SERVER` — stock Admins can manage server settings out of the box, and Roles-tab grants/revocations of "Manage Server" are actually enforced network-wide. (2) `mobile_twitch_settings_route.dart` rendered the Save button INSIDE `if (_enabled)` — toggling verification OFF hid the button, so OFF could never be persisted (desktop overview_tab already had the else-branch fix); button moved outside the block. Full `cargo test --lib` (410 tests incl. harness) green.
- [x] **The REAL Twitch-toggle root cause + nickname + profile-save cluster (fixed 2026-07-16, awaiting live pass; relay deploy pending).** The permission fix above was necessary but not sufficient — four distinct latent bugs (none caused by the Sonar cleanup / settings split, which were investigated and exonerated):
  1. **"Latest authorized write wins" — `AdminLwwReg::merge` was priority-first:** once the Owner ever wrote a register (server setting, rename, role, role_permissions, nickname, twitch username), an Admin's write LOST the merge forever regardless of timestamp — even on the admin's own replica ("toggle reverts; works only for Owner"). Merge is now pure HLC LWW (total order incl. actor); authority stays with `op_allowed` + author gates; `priority` kept as inert serde/wire-compat metadata. Also kills a replica-divergence source (`author_priority` was computed from the role map AT APPLY TIME, which differs mid-sync). Mixed-version caveat: ≤0.8.0 clients merge the old way until updated. Stale frozen `role_permissions` overrides are NOT migrated — the owner re-granting via Roles tab now actually works. Unit tests rewritten + `admin_setting_overwrite_lands_after_owner_write`, `setting_overwrite_converges_regardless_of_apply_order`; harness `admin_flips_owner_setting_and_all_nodes_converge` (owner→admin flip→offline member converges via sync).
  2. **Dart default-permission mirrors ELIMINATED:** `roles_tab.dart` + `mobile_roles_route.dart` each hand-copied `default_permissions()` — both stale (admin missing manageServer; mobile ALSO missing manageEmotes + had no Manage Emotes row), and mobile's Reset persisted the stripped mask as a CRDT override (why mobile felt worse). Both now load defaults via new sync FFI `default_role_permissions(role)`; mobile gained the Manage Emotes toggle.
  3. **Temp nicknames — resolve returned a DEVICE id:** the relay binds a nickname to the WS-auth device id; a stranger's cold resolver can't collapse it, so the friend request joined `inbox:{device}` (a room nobody listens on) and queued forever — pasted MASTER ids worked, multi-device claimers never did. Claim now carries the MASTER through the relay (`claim_nickname` +"master", bounds-checked; `nickname_resolved` +"master_id"; never fed into the resolver — target string only), making nickname adds byte-identical to pasted-master adds. Compat both directions. `NicknameResolveFailed` now shows an error toast (was debugPrint-only silence). MockRelay gained claim/resolve/release; harness `nickname_friend_request_reaches_multi_device_claimer`. **Relay-uws deploy PENDING (needs Vitalik's go).**
  4. **Avatar/banner: 5s dead wait + early-Save image loss:** both platforms awaited the Rust WebP encode BETWEEN crop-Apply and staging the preview, with no indicator — and mobile's always-enabled Save sent `avatarBytes: null` during that window (image silently dropped). Now the cropped PNG stages INSTANTLY (preview updates immediately, small spinner while encoding, generation-guarded against stale completions, revert+toast on failure), and Save AWAITS in-flight processing. `updateMyProfile` rethrows (mobile no longer shows success on a dead node; desktop `_saveProfile` gained try/catch + Saving state). The 5s itself was dev-profile Rust: image/webp crates added to `[profile.dev.package]` opt-level=3. Follow-up candidate with the same await-before-stage shape, `pickAndProcessEmoteImage`, fixed 2026-07-16: now `pickAndNameEmote()` — the name dialog opens instantly with the raw picked bytes as preview, the WebP encode runs in a tracked background future (preview swaps in when it lands), and Save awaits it under a spinner.

- [~] **Conferences — Zoom-style rooms with waiting room (design + v1 IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-13, awaiting visual pass + live 2-machine test; see `reports/CONFERENCES_PLAN.md`).** v1 shipped in code: Rust `node/conference.rs` (virtual server `conf:{id}` = WS room = MLS group; fresh group per Start; blocklist→code→waiting-room gate; admit = add_member→direct Welcome→commit broadcast w/ epoch guard; RAM-only MLS chat attributed by leaf credential; pending swept on PeerLeft/RoomMembers/Disconnected), `api/conference.rs` FFI + `conferences` table, envelope VC-join conference branch (plaintext path stays strict), harness test `conference_waiting_room_admits_denies_and_chats` GREEN. Dart: `conference_provider.dart`, Conferences tab (FriendsBar icon between Saved messages/Help + bottom-bar button), dashboard (rooms CRUD, copy web invite, host waiting-room panel, joiner lobby/denied+code-retry, in-call grid + chat side panel), mobile v1 (`mobile_conferences_route.dart` → reuses MobileVoiceChannelRoute), deep links `hollow://conference/<id>` + `/join#conf=<id>` + chat cards. Phase 2+: co-host ENFORCEMENT at ingest, broadcast preset (needs media forwarding epic below), local RTMP ingest, Flutter-web guest. Durable host-local rooms (SQLCipher; conf_id = unguessable 32-byte link capability, both `hollow://conference/<id>` and `/join#conf=<id>` fragment forms); waiting-room admission IS the MLS add to ad-hoc group `conf#{id}` (subgroup machinery reused; kick = remove + rotation; blocklist drops join requests at ingest); co-hosts = policy permission validated at ingest like server roles; device-only join with master-collapsed display; call surface + SFrame + audio gossip all reused from VCs; RAM-only MLS chat in the VC chat overlay; Conferences manager tab (FriendsBar icon between Saved Messages and Help). Build order: (1) v1 rooms+admission+call, (2) co-hosts/access code, (3) media forwarding epic below, (4) broadcast mode, (later) local RTMP ingest + Flutter-web guest.

- [x] **Interface scale + chat text size (issue #20, 2026-07-26).** In-app display scaling, so "make it bigger" no longer means leaving for Windows "Scale and layout". Two knobs in Settings > Accessibility > Display Size (desktop dialog + mobile tab, one shared implementation in `settings_shared.dart`): **Interface Scale** (75-200% desktop / 90-150% mobile, 5% grid) lays the whole app out at `window/scale` and paints it back through ONE root `Transform` (`ui/components/ui_scale.dart`, applied in `app.dart`'s builder), so text, icons AND spacing scale together without touching ~800 hardcoded `size:` literals; **Chat Text Size** (80-200%) is a text-only `TextScaler` multiplier on the message surfaces (`reversedChatList` + both composers + archive + guest viewer), composed with the OS scaler rather than replacing it. Ctrl + / Ctrl - / Ctrl 0 zoom shortcuts (listed in Settings > Shortcuts); persisted via `_bootstrap` load (`ui_scale`, `chat_text_scale`). Consequence: below the transform window coords != overlay coords, so every popup anchor now goes through `overlay_anchor.dart` (`overlayAnchorOf` / `overlayPositionOf`) - 16 sites converted. Custom emotes are `WidgetSpan`s and scale by hand (also fixes them staying tiny at 2.0x OS text scale). Desktop title bar deliberately stays at OS size (macOS traffic-light alignment). Lockout-proofing (added after the first field test locked the author out of Settings): the applied scale is clamped by `effectiveUiScale()` so the logical viewport never drops under the Settings dialog's own footprint (410x470 desktop / 240x400 mobile, never clamping below 100%), the dialog's flat `minHeight: 420` now yields to the viewport (a min larger than the max is normalised UP in BoxConstraints, which is what clipped its close button), and a browser-style zoom pill appears in the title bar - the one surface OUTSIDE the transform - showing the current % and resetting to 100% on click. When the clamp bites, the slider's subtitle says so. Tests: `ui_scale_test.dart` (layout, hit testing, clamp), `display_scale_settings_test.dart` (commit-on-release vs live), mobile overflow guard at 1.25x/1.5x interface scale.

- [~] **Hollow Shop (artist art shop + support credentials), BUILT Aug to Sep 2026, POSTPONED 2026-09-05.** Design and money-rail research: `reports/ARTIST_SHOP_DESIGN.md` (sections 12 to 14); app client, `.hollowpack`, blind-signed support credentials and the Twitch credential all shipped (memory `project_shop_app_client`, `project_support_credentials_phase2`, `project_twitch_signed_credential`). Creem rejected the merchant account on 2026-09-03 (final, no appeal); Vitalik's reading is the prohibited-list line on marketplaces and merchant-funded payouts, which also rules out the researched alternatives. Decision 2026-09-05: the shop is HIDDEN in the app, not removed: `shopAvailableProvider` = store verdict AND a persisted `shop_unlocked` flag (default off), toggled by an easter egg in Settings (memory `project_shop_app_client` says where; kept out of the public docs on purpose). A store build stays deaf to it. Support marks keep rendering; their tooltips no longer name the shop; a pasted redeem link stays plain text while locked. Verified by a 60-step probe scenario and a 7-case widget test, both deleted at Vitalik's request the same day so the egg stays an egg; `scripts/probe_scenarios/shop_tab.json` still names sample listings the live catalog no longer serves and needs its two target strings refreshed. The shop server stays deployed for the Twitch verifier.
- [x] **Asset pull retry (2026-09-05): GIFs, stickers and custom emotes sent to an offline member now arrive once any holder is reachable.** Before, the bytes were asked for ONCE per connection (Dart per session, Rust per socket) from the DM sender's devices or one arbitrary room member, so a ring-replayed token whose holder was away, or whose roster had not arrived yet, stayed a placeholder forever (Vitalik's "GIF not synced from offline delivery"). Rust now keeps a pending-ask table that outlives the socket and retries on `PeerJoined`, `RoomMembers`, a 20 s tick and a new `missing` reply field on `EmoteAssets`, one candidate at a time, 4 devices per hash per connection, 8 hashes per sweep. Wiki `emotes` > "Asset pull retry"; fleet `scripts/fleet_asset_offline.ps1` (four gates, green 2026-09-05).
- [x] **Channel message retention defaults to PERMANENT (2026-09-05, Vitalik).** An untouched `retention_messages` used to mean 365d, and the sweep pruned everything older on every member's machine, so a community silently lost its first year. Absent now reads as permanent in the sweep (`swarm.rs`) and in both storage dashboards; the owner can still set a window (forward-only from `retention_messages_since`). Files keep the 365d default; the next UX unit gives the file card honest states (see `tmp.txt`).
- [x] **Honest file card states (2026-09-05, tmp.txt item 1).** A card whose bytes are not on disk now says why instead of offering a Download button that can do nothing: `Requesting...` (spinner in the button's place), `<name> is offline. Hollow will fetch it when they return.` (DM) / `Waiting for a peer who has this file` (channel, and a share with no seeders), `<name> no longer has this file`, `Removed by this server's retention policy`; the three dead ends carry NO control (the hover-bar Download still re-issues). Protocol: `HavenMessage::FileUnavailable { file_id, reason }` answers a `FileRequest` ONLY after the same entitlement gate as the bytes and only when a row exists (silence for blocked / unknown / not entitled stays, or "unknown" would leak membership); asker side `node/file_asks.rs` is the asset rail's pending-ask table for files (one holder at a time, asked-set rule, retry on PeerJoined / RoomMembers / the retry sweep, survives reconnects, every dispatch re-stamps the explicit-pull receipt so the gate lets the answer in), `NetworkEvent::FileAvailability` to Dart, ONE decision point `file_card_status.dart` for all five surfaces. Found and fixed on the way: channel-file retention had NEVER fired (`created_at` is ms, the cutoff was seconds); the sweep now normalises units and marks never-fetched rows too, and missing-file sweeps skip expired rows. Harness: six `file_unavailable_*` / `dm_file_request_*` / `channel_file_request_rotates_*` / `expired_answer_*` tests; fleet `scripts/fleet_file_card_states.ps1` (DM waiting then self-heal, DM gone via a deleted holder copy, channel waiting then self-heal) green. The message hover bar, the right-click menu row and the mobile long-press sheet mirror the card through `fileBarAction()` (2026-09-06): `Download` by default, a slashed download reading `Stop waiting for this file` while an ask is queued or in flight (`NodeCommand::CancelFileRequest` drops the ask AND its explicit-pull receipt, so an answer already on its way faces the auto-download gate like any push), `Try again` after a holder said no, nothing when expired; harness `cancel_file_request_drops_the_queued_ask_and_its_receipt`, fleet gate G2b. Still open from the same note: replica pinning (hold-for-server apart from downloaded-for-me, own cap) and a per-channel "followed" concept driving ring registration, live subscription and backfill together. Memory `project_file_card_honest_states`.

- [x] **Mobile audio device picker + "a headset always beats the loudspeaker" (2026-08-15, code complete — Dart half ships in any build, iOS native half needs Vitalik's next Xcode Archive; awaiting device pass).** Reported from the field on iOS: plugging in wired headphones with a mic killed call audio ("no sound, and I think the mic doesn't work either"). **Root cause — Hollow's speaker-on default was a HARD route override.** Voice channels, video calls and camera-on all call `_setSpeakerRoute(true)` → `AudioUtils setSpeakerphoneOn:YES` → `overrideOutputAudioPort:AVAudioSessionPortOverrideSpeaker`, and that override OUTRANKS connected headphones: the call blares out of the iPhone while the user wears silent headphones, and iOS drags capture to the built-in mic along with the output (hence "the mic doesn't work"). Nothing in the UI could undo it — mobile had a binary speaker/earpiece toggle and no device selection at all. Android had the same class of bug from the other direction: `AudioSwitchManager.enableSpeakerphone(true)` called `selectDevice(Speakerphone)`, which PINS the loudspeaker as audioswitch's user-selected device, so a headset plugged in later never took over for the rest of the session. **Fix, four layers.** (1) **The rule, in Dart** (`core/services/audio_route.dart`): `AudioRoutes.preferLoudRoute(true)` is the new meaning of "speaker on" — the loudest SENSIBLE route, which is the headset whenever one is attached (`setSpeakerphoneOnButPreferBluetooth`, i.e. DefaultToSpeaker with no override, so the loudspeaker still wins the moment it unplugs) and the loudspeaker only when nothing is. Both call surfaces route every speaker decision through it. (2) **The same rule natively, for the paths Dart can't reach** — `setSpeakerphoneOn:YES` now asks `+[AudioUtils hasExternalAudioRoute]` and degrades to `PortOverrideNone` when a headset/BT/USB/CarPlay device is attached; this also covers the plugin's own re-asserts (`startScreenAudioPlayer`). `hasExternalAudioRoute` checks currentRoute.outputs AND availableInputs, because an override already in effect HIDES the headset from currentRoute while its input port stays listed. `healSpeakerRouteIfClobbered` gained the mirror case: output pinned to the built-in speaker while a headset is attached = stale override, release it (it previously only healed the receiver case). Android: `enableSpeakerphone(true)` picks the connected BT/wired device over the speaker pin, and `enableSpeakerButPreferBluetooth` stopped letting list order decide between BT and wired. (3) **The picker** (`ui/mobile/mobile_audio_route_sheet.dart` + `core/providers/audio_route_provider.dart`): the in-call speaker button becomes an audio-device button — plain speaker/earpiece toggle while only the built-in routes exist, route sheet as soon as a headset is attached, long-press always opens the sheet, and its icon shows where audio ACTUALLY is (headset/bluetooth/car/AirPlay glyphs) so being stuck on the phone is visible at a glance. Wired to both the 1:1 call screen and the voice-channel route. On iOS a route is one thing, so picking a device sets input AND output (`setPreferredInput:` + clearing the override — you cannot pick an iOS output directly); on Android it's an audioswitch device class. The live route is read from the platform (new `hollowSelectedAudioOutput` channel: audioswitch's selected device / the current route's portType) rather than from our own last write, because the OS re-routes on its own; `onDeviceChange` (already emitted by both platforms on hotplug) drives the refresh. (4) **Proximity blanking now gates on the actual route being the EARPIECE**, not on `!isSpeakerOn` — headphones in a voice call left the flag false, so the screen blanked at every passing object. Also fixed while in there: `selectAudioInput`/`selectAudioOutput` on iOS replied TWICE on one FlutterResult (a hard engine error), and `selectAudioInput` skipped re-applying a port whose cached portType matched, so re-picking a replugged headset was a no-op. Tests: `test/audio_route_test.dart` (12) pins the rule itself — headset attached ⇒ never the hard override, headset behind an active override still discovered via its input port, picking a headset clears the override BEFORE pinning the input, plus both platform vocabularies in the classifier.

- [x] **Wayland screen share — window sharing + libwebrtc null-safety (issue #30 follow-up, DONE 2026-07-31, awaiting Wayland tester pass).** Both halves shipped in one libwebrtc rebuild (dll+so, m144 @ aaeeee8 + wrapper be9743f). **(a) Null-safety folded into `hollow-screencast.patch`** (standalone `hollow-wayland-desktop-capture.patch` deleted): `RTCDesktopCapturerImpl` builds the raw capturer first and REJECTS null (Start → `CS_FAILED`), `RTCDesktopMediaListImpl` tolerates a null capturer (empty list), `MediaSourceImpl::UpdateThumbnail` tolerates a null media list — a mispredicted session shape is now an empty list/failed start, never a SIGSEGV; the plugin also checks `Start()`'s return and errors instead of handing Dart a dead track. **(b) Portal-first window sharing:** `DesktopType` gained `kAnyScreenContent` + appended-virtual `RTCDesktopDevice::CreateDesktopCapturer(type, source_id, show_cursor)` → webrtc's GENERIC PipeWire capturer (portal offers screens AND windows in ONE prompt, no media list ever built — enumeration is what popped the extra portal dialogs). Restore tokens ride webrtc's own `RestoreTokenManager`: the plugin's `wayland-portal:<generation>` deviceId sentinel maps generation → stable source id (base 1e9), so re-sharing with the same generation silently restores the previous pick for the process lifetime and the picker's "Pick something new" bumps the generation for a fresh prompt. Dart: `DesktopCaptureSupport.usePortalPicker` — the share dialog on Wayland shows ONE "Screen or window" entry (no thumbnails, no 3s refresh timer, no enumeration; quality/audio/profile controls kept, system-wide-audio caveat noted), and both capture paths (`screen_share_service.createOffer`, `voice_channel_provider.startScreenShare`) skip the pre-capture `getSources` prime for portal ids. X11 sessions keep the full enumerated picker. `feedback_wayland_window_capture_sigsegv`.

- [X] **Wayland + Windows global PTT/mute hotkeys — round 4 (2026-08-04): Wayland portal backend BUILT (awaiting Wayland tester), Windows PTT RESOLVED (field-verified same day). macOS still open.** **RESOLUTION: the two "broken" field rounds were a config miss, not code — Voice Activity mode was still selected, so the PTT binding was (correctly) never registered; with Push to Talk actually enabled everything works end-to-end.** The round-4 hardening below stays valuable and shipped. Follow-up thought for discoverability: pressing the PTT combo while in Voice Activity mode gives zero feedback — a one-time hint ("PTT is off — enable it in Audio & Video") would have saved three debugging rounds. **(a) Wayland — `WaylandPortalBackend` (`hotkeys/wayland_portal_backend.dart`) via org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts** (KDE 5.25+/GNOME 48+; `dbus` package, now a direct dep): async `detect()` (probes the interface `version` property on a Wayland session; in-app backend stays the fallback and covers the gap until detection lands, controller re-registers via `_reevaluate()` when the portal attaches), `CreateSession`→`BindShortcuts` with `preferred_trigger` hints in freedesktop shortcuts-spec syntax ("CTRL+space" — new `xkbName` table in hotkey_binding.dart), Activated/Deactivated signals = press AND release so hold-PTT works, compositor consent dialog handled by the portal. Key contract points honored: Request::Response subscribed BEFORE the method call on the token-derived request path (the documented beat-the-subscription race), BindShortcuts is once-per-session + bound shortcuts persist per app → ONE session kept for the process lifetime (stop() only detaches edge routing; a changed binding set closes + rebinds; full close on controller dispose). **(b) Windows PTT — the round-3 mystery was dismantled rather than re-theorized:** a standalone Dart replica of the exact poller (same FFI signature, tick predicate, 25ms Timer) against real GetAsyncKeyState with SendInput-injected held Ctrl+Space produced perfect press/release edges → the poller was never the problem; new `test/hotkey_controller_test.dart` (HotkeyController grew a `testPoller` seam) then proved registration self-heals across slow settings loads AND the first-call invalidate dance in Riverpod 2.6.1 → the controller logic was fine too. What WAS broken and is now fixed: (1) an unparseable stored keybind string silently killed ONLY that action (mute/deafen kept working on their defaults — the exact field asymmetry); `add()` now falls back to the default binding + logs; (2) `pttReleaseDelayProvider` was never listened, so the first PTT release always used the 200ms default; (3) ALL `[HOLLOW-HOTKEY]` diagnostics were debugPrint-only = INVISIBLE in installed builds, which is why two field rounds produced zero data — every line (mode pushes, registration incl. raw stored strings + AsyncValue state, edges, PTT routing, both notifiers' tx-gate applications, VC service setMuted) now also rides `logFromDart` into hollow_debug.log; (4) `pttStateProvider` is written FIRST in `_routePtt` so the mic icon reflects the key even if a notifier throws; (5) both pollers got hold-asymmetry — a held action releases on the TRIGGER key alone (mirrors InAppKeyBackend), so mid-hold modifier taps / chord release order can't chop a transmission. Also ruled out on the dev machine: PowerToys Peek (claims Ctrl+Space, but disabled). If the next field run still fails, hollow_debug.log now bisects it in one shot — check `Backend started` for the binding list + mode, then `Edge:`, then `VC tx gate:`. **(c) macOS global hotkeys (CGEventTap + Accessibility permission) remain the sibling follow-up.**

- [ ] **macOS call-recorder parity for the 2026-08-05 fixes (needs the Mac build loop).** `MacScreenRecorder.m` still writes TWO AAC tracks (system + mic) — players render only track 1, so mac recordings miss the recorder's own voice; mix into ONE track like the rewritten `win_screen_recorder.cc` (and check device selection matches Hollow's configured endpoints, not system defaults). ALSO: mic test (#40) FINAL design = record RAW (no WebRTC) → offline-render through the real chain → A/B review; the render entry point `hollowRenderVoiceWav`/`RenderVoiceWavOffline` lives in common/cpp (Win+Linux only) — mirror it into the ObjC plugin (`CaptureGainProcessor.m` port + `FlutterWebRTCPlugin.m` dispatch) or the mac mic test fails its render step with a clean error toast (raw playback still works). Ledger: memory `project_mic_test_record_review`. `project_issue53_call_recorder`, `project_mic_test_record_review`.

- [x] **Rebindable shortcuts — the whole Settings > Shortcuts page is editable in place (2026-08-04).** New `AppShortcut` enum + `appShortcutsProvider` (`app_shortcuts_provider.dart`): 9 General shortcuts (settings/member panel/quick search/split view/pane focus/3× zoom) + 5 chat-formatting shortcuts, persisted as ONE JSON overrides key (`app_shortcuts` — defaults never hit disk, so changing a default in code reaches every user who didn't rebind; unparseable overrides fall back to the default, same rule as the voice keybinds). Enforcement rewired to the live map: HollowShell `_handleGlobalKey` matches via `HotkeyBinding.matchesEvent` (AltGr guard intact; zoom keeps its numpad/shift-tolerant aliases ONLY while on the default binding via `_matchZoom`), `handleChatInputKey` gained `formatBindings:` (both desktop panes pass `ref.read(appShortcutsProvider).valueOrNull`; null = defaults keeps mobile untouched). The page (`shortcuts_section.dart`, now stateful with the post-frame invalidate against the bootstrap-not-build trap): every row = label + `KeybindCaptureField` + a reset-to-default arrow when overridden; the Voice trio edits the SAME providers as Audio & Video (one source of truth); Enter/Shift+Enter stay fixed (structural). Guards: bare typable triggers (plain letter/digit/punct) are refused with a toast for app shortcuts — they'd fire while typing (F-keys etc. allowed; voice bindings exempt, they're call-gated + typing-suppressed); HollowShell's global handler now NO-OPS while any keybind capture field is armed (previously capturing a combo could fire the shortcut being rebound, e.g. Ctrl+Shift+P toggling the member panel mid-capture). Tests: `test/app_shortcuts_test.dart` (default round-trip, collision check, corrupt-JSON/override fallbacks).

- [x] **Pending server joins, rung 1 (2026-08-29): a join into a server whose members are ALL offline PARKS instead of failing.** The request rides the server room's `~join` topic ring (zero relay changes: rings register per (room, topic), catch-up skips own frames), the answer rides the existing device-keyed 0x04 buffer because the joiner rejoins the room at boot, and every verdict is written back into the ring as `ServerJoinResolved` so a late member converges membership and never re-serves. CRDT-first: the MLS leaf still forms on co-presence (the existing `MlsKeyPackageRequest` heal), with a "waiting for a member to finish setup" badge in between; a carried KeyPackage is rung 2 and needs KP private-half persistence at mint first. Persisted `pending_server_joins` row + `PendingStripItem` tile (desktop strip, Dock bar, mobile row; not selectable; click = menu with Discard / Copy invite / Request again), attribution from the carried signed device list, ban/private/cap gates master-keyed, Twitch proof stripped from the ring copy, interactive refusals delete the row and show the dialog, `ServerJoinRejected` carries the nonce. Design: `reports/PENDING_JOINS_ASYNC_FRIENDING.md`; memory `project_pending_server_joins`.

- [x] **DONE 2026-09-05: the MLS-first-else sweep, KeyPackage persistence, the double-KeyPackage join bootstrap, and pending-joins rung 2 (the carried KeyPackage).** Two Opus units under Fable, harness-first, an honesty proof on every guard. **Sweep:** CRDT ops (the `StoragePledgeChanged` auto-pledge, `MemberAdded`) send the plaintext `CrdtOpBroadcast` twin UNCONDITIONALLY (their targets read state the op never drains); encrypted content and ephemeral signals (channel typing, `ProfileUpdate` whose `mls_reached` now means "holds a leaf", `VaultManifestBroadcast`, `ShardDelete`, the channel `FileHeader`) send MLS PLUS the Olm or plaintext copy to exactly `crypto_handler::leafless_member_devices()` (online member devices with no leaf in OUR group; subgroup non-qualifiers filtered by `can_see_channel`), so a formed group costs zero extra frames; `broadcast_vc_state_signal` mirrors `broadcast_vc_presence` (unconditional twin). Not covered by the complement rule: a member at a STALE epoch (still a leaf), which the CRDT-op twins and the decrypt-failure channel sync cover. Harness: `member_added_and_pledge_ops_reach_a_deaf_member`, `vc_state_signal_reaches_a_deaf_member`, `channel_typing_and_profile_update_reach_a_member_without_a_leaf`, `channel_file_header_reaches_a_member_without_a_leaf`; the leaf-less member that discriminates is a raw relay socket admitted from the ring by a legacy request, because a deaf node forms a leaf in under a second through the targeted Welcome and syncs state on co-presence. **KeyPackage persistence:** `mint_key_package` (generate + `persist_mls_state`) is the only mint in `node/`, guarded by the source-scanning `key_package_mints_persist_mls_state`; `discard_key_package` reclaims the bundle on discard or reject. **Join bootstrap:** the join-time KeyPackage targets `server_bootstrap_target` and stamps `mls_bootstrap_requested` only when it reached a device (the raw responder fallback stays unstamped); a commit that evicts a still-member leaf returns `CommitApplyOutcome::Evicted`, stamps the throttle without sending and arms `mls_welcome_grace` (6 s, swept on the batch tick), because the removal half of a remove + re-add always precedes its Welcome and the Welcome had just cleared the throttle (that was the third KeyPackage; epoch 62 and climbing in the honesty proof). Guard `three_member_live_join_lands_at_minimal_epoch`: epoch 2, ONE KeyPackage per joiner on the wire, a leaf repair costs exactly two. **Rung 2:** `ServerJoinRequest.key_package` (`#[serde(default)]`) rides the PARKED ring copy only, minted once per pending row (`pending_server_joins.key_package`); the admitter queues it after every gate and only when `key_package_identity(kp) == peer_str` (wiki `security_write_gates` section 5); the batch tick addresses the Welcome for an absent device into the server room by name so the relay buffers it FIFO behind the snapshot and SyncResponse; the joiner completing such a row sends nothing, stamps the throttle and arms the grace; after the Welcome `sync_handler::request_channel_catchups` re-issues the channel catch-up. Vitalik after the fleet run: the pending tile took the full 15 s live window to appear even with nobody in the server, so `handle_join_server` now arms a second, 3 s timer (`CheckPendingJoinTimeout { only_if_empty: true }`) that parks ONLY when the server room still holds no other device; a room with a silent member present keeps the 15 s window (`JOIN_EMPTY_ROOM_WINDOW` / `JOIN_LIVE_WINDOW`, harness `empty_server_join_parks_within_the_short_window` plus `join_with_a_silent_member_present_keeps_the_long_window`). Found on the way, pre-existing and left alone: `WsEvent::PeerJoined` inserts whatever id the relay names, so a socket that joins a room it is ALREADY in gets its OWN device id into `ws_room_peers[room]` (the relay lists the joiner in its own existing-members set); `RoomMembers` and `DiscoveredPeers` filter self, `PeerJoined` does not, and any "is this room empty" reader must filter our ids until the insert site does. Harness: `restart_node` over the same DB (`spawn_node_on_db` now loads the Olm account like production), `parked_join_key_package_survives_a_restart_before_the_welcome`, `parked_join_completes_with_zero_overlap` extended (a message sent before the joiner returns is decrypted by the joiner ALONE). Residuals: the `MlsWelcome` arm drops an existing group BEFORE staging, so a duplicate Welcome leaves a device group-less until the grace re-asks (fix = stage first, drop on success); an admitter holding no group cannot seat the leaf (rung 1 behaviour, logged); a mock-relay artifact (device id == master id doubles buffered frames) means restart and parked tests use distinct device tags. Fleet (`scripts/fleet_pending_join.ps1`, fresh identities, real relay, 2026-09-05): 8/8 PASS; a, alone, logged "Queued the carried KeyPackage of parked joiner" then "Buffered the Welcome for absent device"; b, returning alone, logged "Server join completed", "carried a KeyPackage; expecting a buffered Welcome" and "Joined MLS group, epoch 1" in the SAME second, and the awaiting-setup badge never appeared. One residual seen there: the plaintext twin of `ServerDeleted` arrives after the MLS copy already drained the state and is logged as `[HOLLOW-SECURITY] REJECTED CrdtOp ServerDeleted: author lacks permission`, a false security line for a benign duplicate; the ingest should recognise an op already in the op log (or a tombstone on a deleted shell) BEFORE the permission check and log it as a duplicate. Verification by Fable: security-bearing diffs read line by line, named tests rerun, full nextest suite 808/808 twice under load, clippy clean on new lines. Memory `project_pending_server_joins`, `feedback_mls_first_fallback_dead_targets`, `feedback_mls_patterns`.
- [x] **DONE 2026-09-05, found by the sweep's negative test: restricted-channel BACKFILL bypassed the per-channel subgroup, and the sync responders never checked membership at all.** The `ChannelSyncRequest` and `ChannelSyncProbe` responders (plaintext in swarm.rs, plus their MLS/Olm twins `handle_envelope_channel_sync_req` / `handle_envelope_channel_probe`) gated only on holding the server, so a plain Member pulled an Admin-only channel's whole history, its file headers with their AES keys, and (through `replicate_channel_file_full`, which streamed to every member device) its bytes; and because an unknown peer's role resolves to plain `Member`, a stranger who joined the server's relay room could pull any Everyone-visibility channel, the probe alone leaking its message count and latest timestamp. Fix = ONE helper `crypto_handler::channel_readable_by(state, requester, cid)` = `(is_member(master) OR is_channel_public(cid)) AND can_see_channel(master, cid)`, asked first by both sync responders, both twins, the `FileRequest` channel arm (paired with the existing `public_ok`), full replication and `channel_fallback_holder`; a refusal returns. Public channels unchanged (guests read them through the ring and `PublicChannelMessage`). Harness `restricted_channel_history_and_files_never_reach_a_non_qualifier`: a plain Member ends with no row, no header, no bytes for the Admin-only channel while still receiving `#general` backfill, and a stranger's raw socket gets zero probe answers; honesty proofs for both rungs. Wiki `security_write_gates` section 7. Unpushed until the next release, like every other hole. Residual: `can_see_channel` is false for a channel whose `ChannelAdded` op has not landed on the responder yet, so it refuses instead of serving until the next sync round. Memory `project_restricted_channel_backfill_gate`.
- [ ] **The DM Olm handshake runs TWO glare rounds, and the harness accepts the transient between them (found 2026-09-05 while triaging a flake; pre-existing at `30de964`, 3 of 40 runs).** A passing `call_signal_routes_to_friend_device_and_drops_unknown` trace shows, for one friend pair: "KeyBundle glare, we're higher, deferring", "Created outbound (unconfirmed) session via KeyBundle" twice, "Already have session, ignoring KeyBundle", "PreKey undecryptable with existing session", two "Decrypt FAILED: MAC tag mismatch", a second glare round, and only then "confirmed via decrypted reply". The device-id tiebreaker (2026-06) was meant to make one round deterministic; the DM-room co-presence "handshake-race heal" re-keys on PeerJoined AND on RoomMembers ("no session, re-keying" twice) and looks like what seeds the second round. Product half: make one KeyBundle exchange converge (one re-key per pair per connection, or the heal must not fire while a KeyRequest is in flight). Harness half: `expect_dm_pair_ready` must wait for a SETTLED pair (confirmed both ways across two polls 1500 ms apart with no flip to unconfirmed), because today it returns inside the transient and the call invite goes out under the session about to be replaced; the failing trace shows the exact loss: "Send invite" then "No Olm session with <peer>: call signal invite DROPPED, requesting key bundle", because the decrypt-failure self-heal tore the first session down a few ms after pair-ready returned, and a call signal is never retried; the test fails about 1 in 10 runs, alone or under load. Memory `project_multinode_test_harness` (known intermittent).

- [x] **DONE 2026-09-03 (same commit as the Twitch item below): `support_creds_sig` by the master key over `(peer_id, updated_at, field)`, verified in `social::gated_support_creds` (the ONE door), per-master pin `user_profiles.support_creds_signed` set on the first valid signature, an unsigned or badly signed copy for a pinned master is treated as ABSENT (preserve, logged once, never cleared), a strictly older `updated_at` is ignored even when signed; wiki `security_write_gates` row added; harness `support_creds_sig_pins_and_a_stripped_field_is_preserved` shows the relay strip wiping a mark before the change and preserved after.** Was: **`support_creds` is NOT under the master's profile signature, so a hostile relay can strip a holder's marks (found 2026-09-03 by the hide/remove unit's report-only check; denial only, never forgery).** `profile_signing_payload` (`node/crypto_handler.rs:332-349`) covers `peer_id, display_name, status, about_me, twitch_username, avatar_hash` + `updated_at`; `support_creds` is deliberately outside it (`node/support_creds.rs:33-38`). On the plaintext `HavenMessage::ProfileUpdate` fallback a relay rewrites the field to `""` in flight, the signature still verifies (`social::verified_profile_proof`, `social.rs:1417-1441`), `sanitize_incoming_support_creds(Some(""))` is the explicit clear, and `save_profile` admits it because the freshness guard (`storage/messages.rs:2718-2720`) accepts an EQUAL `updated_at` and anything up to 24 h older (so a replay of a genuine older profile from before the credential clears it too). Blast radius: per receiver, cosmetic, restored by the holder's next genuine announce; since the 2026-09-03 union, a sibling's ROW is also a publish source, so a poisoned row can re-announce the clear from that device until the minting device republishes. Fix shape (a compatibility decision, NOT a one-liner): a second signature `support_creds_sig` over `(peer_id, updated_at, support_creds)` under the master key, verified by new clients when present, and REQUIRED for a master once any signed announce from it was seen (a per-master pin, the same baseline rule as the device list), so stripping the sig field is not a downgrade; old clients ignore the field. Add the `security_write_gates` row when built. Do it with the Twitch credential unit below, which puts a second credential type on the same field.
- [x] **DONE 2026-09-03 (HOLLOW commit after Vitalik's own-account test; shop `20cbb38`, live build `01a06660`): `T_TWITCH_OWNER=3` and `T_TWITCH_FOLLOW=4` in `node/support_creds.rs` with the contract's KATs, the 90-day window checked against the clock with one window of grace, the shop's `/api/twitch/key` + `/api/twitch/verify` re-deriving every fact from Twitch's answer to the user's token (per-channel keys per (t, item, window), token never stored), the purple chip drawn ONLY from a verified t=3 entry (`twitchLoginProvider`; the old field and member op stay on the wire, never rendered), Connect ends with the verify and Disconnect removes the credential, the join gate verifies a t=4 credential offline against the joiner's resolved master (`twitch::validate_follow_credential`; the old JSON shape refused with the update sentence), parked joins carry it on the ring, and the follow-days setting is a picker of the ten steps on both settings pages. Design + contract in memory `project_twitch_signed_credential`.** Was: **Twitch identity and gate become blind-signed credentials (DESIGNED 2026-09-03, decisions taken by Vitalik; BUILD RIGHT AFTER the support-credential hide/remove controls are committed, as TWO Opus units in parallel, app + shop host; design and code map in memory `project_twitch_signed_credential`).** The hole: `twitch::validate_proof` trusts the JOINER-produced JSON and never contacts Twitch; the profile `twitch_username` is inside `profile_signing_payload` but under the subject's OWN key (a self-declaration), and `set_twitch_username` -> `handle_set_twitch_username` writes the member-level `TwitchUsernameChanged` op with NO Twitch check at all (renderers prefer it over the profile field). A modified client passes any gate and wears any streamer handle in the purple chip. The fix, same machinery as the shop credential (`node/support_creds.rs`, RFC 9474 blind signatures under per-purpose RSA keys chained to the ONE pinned root): (1) profile: new type `T_TWITCH_OWNER = 3`, `parts = [login]`, `item = hash(parts)`, `period = floor(days / 90)` REQUIRED non-zero and checked against the clock at verify (current or previous window; the first credential type where `period` means time); cap 1; the chip draws ONLY from a verified entry, an unverified handle renders NOTHING (his call: no 'claims to be' chip), the old field and op stay on the wire for old clients; (2) the join gate in the SAME unit: `T_TWITCH_FOLLOW = 4` over `parts = [channel_login]` with the follow age and sub tier the owner's gate needs carried in the signed message (exact encoding decided in the brief), so the gate verifies offline and a parked join can carry the credential on the `~join` ring (it names no Twitch identity, which lifts the rung-1 strip below); (3) verifier on the shop host (issuer seed, `hollowpack` binary, sealing helper already there): table `twitch_keys(login, period, pub, key_sig, secret_enc)`, `POST /api/twitch/key {token}` validates the token at `id.twitch.tv/oauth2/validate` (no scope, no client secret; `client_id` must be ours), makes or fetches the (login, period) key, answers the chain; `POST /api/twitch/verify {token, blinded}` validates again, login must match the key, blind-signs; the token is never stored or logged, per-token-hash bucket, no IP; the server learns 'login X verified in window N' and never a Hollow identity; (4) app: Connect Twitch ends with the verify (silent re-verify at the window roll from the persisted refresh token), Disconnect removes the entry and republishes; `republish_support_creds` filters by `t` when the hide toggle is on (support marks only). Accepted with eyes open: an account holder can mint the credential for a friend's identity (their OAuth consent is the gate; the whole fix targets the case where you do NOT hold the account). Rung-1 limit this lifts: parked server joins strip `twitch_proof_json` from the `~join` ring copy because that JSON carries `twitch_user_id` + `twitch_username`; with the follow credential (unlinkable, no username) the proof CAN ride the ring copy and Twitch-gated servers get zero-overlap joins like everyone else.

- [ ] **Per-app share audio for Wayland portal shares (follow-up to the portal-first picker above).** A portal window pick exposes no XID and never tells the app WHICH window was granted, so the `--window-xid` per-app path is unreachable and share audio on Wayland is SYSTEM-wide minus Hollow — honest (the dialog says so under the toggle, so it's not a silent fallback, which keeps the "per-app never silently falls back to system" rule intact) but still leaks other apps' audio into a single-window share. Research first, then build: (1) check whether the granted PipeWire VIDEO node's properties carry anything identifying the source app on GNOME/KDE (node props / compositor metadata — likely compositor-specific or absent); (2) if identifiable, map app → its pipewire-pulse sink-inputs and feed the existing `LinuxPulseCapture` per-app machinery; (3) if NOT identifiable, add an explicit "which app's audio?" picker step (list of audio-playing apps from PulseAudio sink-inputs) rather than guessing — NEVER silently capture system audio while claiming per-app. Wayland-only; X11 window shares already do real per-app via XID. `feedback_wayland_window_capture_sigsegv`, `project_linux_screen_audio`.

- [x] **DONE 2026-09-06: Linux auto-update for BOTH install kinds, plus a self-hosted flatpak repository (never Flathub).** ONE detector in Rust, `linux_install_kind()` (`/.flatpak-info` present = `flatpak`, else `tarball`); Dart reads it once through the lazy `linuxInstallKind` and `apply_update`, `launch_update_script` and `spawn_relaunch_waiter` all branch on it. **Tarball:** the manifest gained `sha256_linux_targz` (`hollow-manifest fill-hashes` hashes `url_linux_targz` like the other three; the live 0.10.1 manifest was re-signed with it), Dart downloads `<v>.tar.gz`, probes the app dir AND its parent for writability (a root-owned `/opt` extract fails loudly instead of half-applying), Rust `apply_update_tarball` extracts with `tar xzf` (never the `zip` crate, which drops exec bits and symlinks) into `<data>/updates/staging-<v>`, checks `bundle/hollow` is executable, and writes `update.sh`: wait for our pid, `mv app app.old`, `mv staged app` (restoring `.old` if that fails), relaunch with `nohup` forwarding the original argv (a dropped `--portable` flips the profile, #47), and if the new binary is gone after 8 s swap `.old` back and relaunch the previous version; `launch_update_script()` starts it under `setsid` and Dart exits. **Flatpak:** the downloaded `.flatpak` bundle (the SAME signed-manifest + sha256 trust chain as every platform) is installed ON THE HOST from inside the sandbox: `flatpak-spawn --host flatpak install -y --noninteractive --user|--system <bundle>` (scope read off `/.flatpak-info` `app-path`, synchronous while Settings shows "Installing", the running instance keeps its old deployment, "already installed" counts as success so a retry after a failed relaunch still relaunches), then a host-side `relaunch.sh` waits for our `instance-id` to leave `flatpak ps`, restores `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` from `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus` and `exec flatpak run com.anonlisten.Hollow <argv>`; `spawn_relaunch_waiter()` (profile switch, relay apply, device link, revocation self-nuke) uses the same host recipe inside a flatpak, because the sandbox PID namespace dies with the app and silently took the old in-sandbox waiter with it. `com.anonlisten.Hollow.yml` states `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` (already implied by `--socket=session-bus`). Settings copy: "Installing"/"Preparing" during the apply step; a flatpak's ready card reads "v<x> is installed" + "Restart now". **Self-hosted repo:** `flatpak/build-flatpak.sh` builds and exports in ONE `flatpak-builder` run into a PERSISTENT out-of-tree OSTree repo (`FLATPAK_REPO_DIR`), GPG-signs every commit (ed25519 `B977A875156503E4848245059E1688D3ED9DDEE0`, homedir `~/.hollow-release/gnupg` on the VM, private backups on the VM and in `C:\Users\Jabun\.hollow-release\`, public half committed as `flatpak/hollow-flatpak.gpg` and embedded in every bundle), runs `build-update-repo --generate-static-deltas --prune-depth=5`, writes `hollow.flatpakrepo` + `hollow.flatpakref` into the repo, stamps the build version into the SHIPPED metainfo copy (software centres had shown 0.9.4 for six releases), and builds the bundle with `--repo-url=https://flatpak.anonlisten.com --gpg-keys` so a bundle install registers a LIVE origin; `scripts/publish_flatpak_repo.sh` rsyncs from the VM (or `--via-tar` through Windows while the VM has no key for the host); `build_linux_release.sh` publishes only under `FLATPAK_PUBLISH=1`; an unset `FLATPAK_GPG_KEY` = a loud, unsigned dev build with no repo URL. The live repo was seeded with the REAL 0.10.1 bundle via `build-import-bundle` and its metadata files carry no-cache headers. **Verified:** end-to-end script tests on the VM (real `tar`, real swap, real rollback, real relaunch; honesty proof = a sabotaged `mv` fails the test), a host install from inside the real 0.10.1 sandbox while a second instance runs (the instance survives, the commit changes), a host-side `setsid` child outliving the sandbox, `flatpak update` pulling a delta from a `file://` copy of the repo, a `--repo-url` bundle installed over a dead-origin install registering the remote, `flutter analyze` + `test/updater_manifest_test.dart` + `cargo test --lib api::updater` on both hosts. **Hosting note:** Hostinger's CDN (`hcdn`) answers libostree's metadata fetches with a 403 JS challenge at ANY security level, on every CDN-fronted hostname (apex, `hollow.`, `shop.`), so the repo moved to its own subdomain website `flatpak.anonlisten.com` (same docroot `public_html/hollow/flatpak`) with the CDN switched OFF for that one website, a plain A record to the origin; the in-app bundle path and every release download were never affected. An UNSIGNED bundle is refused over an install whose origin has `gpg-verify=true` ("GPG verification enabled, but no signatures found"), so the live 0.10.1 bundle was rebuilt from the live repo's own commit (same content, same commit `7401fe3f`, now signed, origin baked) and the manifest re-signed; from here on every release bundle MUST come out of `build-flatpak.sh` with the key set. `flatpak update` also refuses an older-timestamp commit, so the live repo only ever receives release commits in time order. Real-desktop click test of the 0.10.0-labelled artifacts in `installer\Output\linux-updater-test\` (tarball updates to the live 0.10.1 tarball, flatpak to the live 0.10.1 bundle) = Vitalik. See `project_linux_auto_update`.

- [~] **Media forwarding — steps 1+2 SHIPPED; step 3 phases 1 (VPS infra forwarder) + 2 (viewer-peer forwarders) SHIPPED + FIELD-VERIFIED (all four runs 2026-08-07: egress = k×ingest, relay media = 0 on the peer path); PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-08 — Windows live-setParameters root-caused+fixed in the plugin (scalabilityMode ""/ssrc 0 round-trip poison), rid f/q simulcast on ingest legs with engine-side per-viewer packet selection (VP8 switch rewrite via str0m Vp8Patch), and upload spreading (`maxDirectShareCopies=1`: direct viewers ride branches, self-promotion, 15-cap now effectively dynamic) — field verification pending (checklist in `reports/MEDIA_FORWARDING_PLAN.md` §7 top entry; deploy the VPS forwarder BEFORE clients); feeder election deferred to its own session.** Supersedes "extend the voice gossip tree to video": the audio tree forwards TRACKS (decode→re-encode per hop — fine for Opus, CPU/quality death for video); video forwarding must be PACKET-level (forwarders relay SFrame ciphertext RTP they can never read or tamper with — availability helper, never authority). Verified baseline (2026-07-13): only AUDIO forwards today (mesh→gossip at 6+, `voice_handler.rs` thresholds 6/4, ≤12 neighbors); `voice_channel_service.dart` onTrack skips video; screen share = per-viewer PC service hard-capped at 15 outgoing / 10 incoming viewers (`maxScreenShareOutgoing/Incoming` — raised from 5/3 in Phase 6.75; older docs saying "5" are stale), no forwarding. **Step 1 — receiver-driven resolution capping (COMPLETE 2026-08-05, field-verified same day on a Windows→VM DM call — clamp to viewer display, Source toggle, and live received-resolution label all confirmed):** viewer's `screen_watch{want}` now carries `viewer_width/viewer_height/source_quality` (both DM `call_screen_watch` + VC `vc_screen_watch`, `#[serde(default)]`; viewer res = largest physical display via `viewer_display.dart`, platformDispatcher NOT MediaQuery); sharer downscales EACH watcher's own encoder (per-viewer PCs = per-viewer encoders — no shared cap, no renegotiation on 4K-viewer join) via `ScreenShareService.effectiveViewerCap` (orientation-normalized long/short clamp, never raises the share cap) at offer time, and a RE-SENT watch live-updates a streaming viewer's cap via `updateResolutionCap` (setParameters path; writes `_capWidth/_capHeight` first so the 2s post-connect enforcement re-applies the NEW cap) — **FIELD FINDING (VM test 2026-08-05): Windows libwebrtc REJECTS every live setParameters on the share sender (readback scale never changes; the cap only ever applied via init sendEncodings), so `updateResolutionCap` returns bool and BOTH providers fall back to renegotiation on false (fresh offer, new cap in init encodings — the proven re-watch path, ~1-2s restart)**; explicit per-viewer "Source quality" request (`ShareSourceQualityChip` on all 4 watch surfaces — desktop VC pane, desktop DM chat pane, mobile VC + DM top bars), OFF by default, per watch session never sticky, lifts only that one connection; absent fields (old client) = source behavior both directions. Common case (4K sharer, 1080p room) = ~4× bandwidth AND encode-CPU saving. Tests: harness `voice_channel_join_leave_and_signal_routing` + `call_signal_routes_to_friend_device_and_drops_unknown` (field round-trips), `test/share_viewer_cap_test.dart` (clamp math). **Step 2 — multi-hop originator attribution (prerequisite for any tree, buildable now):** forwarded streams signal (originator, source kind, stream id); UI attribution + dedup + watch-gate consent + SFrame cryptor registration key on the ORIGINATOR (whose key encrypted the frames), transport stays keyed on the delivering neighbor — the master-vs-device split applied to media. **Step 3 — forwarder role (ONE component, two hosts):** viewer-peers with upload headroom AND/OR an infra peer on the VPS receive SFrame RTP and fan packets downstream; beats TURN (blind per-connection pipe, 2×stream relay cost per restricted-NAT viewer) at 1 ingest + 1 egress each (10+10k vs 20k Mbps); the ingest can come from ANY well-connected receiving peer, not just the sharer; simulcast layers (`sendEncodings`) let forwarders adapt per-viewer quality by packet SELECTION, never re-encode; heal = existing receiver-initiates/sender-catches; all-STUN rooms cost the relay ZERO media bytes. NOTE the lane split (memory `feedback_share_vs_screen_share_lanes`): Hollow Share (files) = STUN-only; SCREEN share rides the call config WITH TURN, so restricted-NAT viewers cost relay bandwidth TODAY — the forwarder saving is real. Needed for: large-VC webcams, share beyond 5 viewers, conference broadcast mode.
- [ ] Discord import system (full implementation — parse GDPR export ZIP, map servers/channels/roles/messages, placeholder identities, member claiming) == reflect to the discord_migration_plan.md
- [ ] At-rest file encryption — encrypt files in `~/.hollow/files/`, `~/.hollow/vault/`, and `~/.hollow/vault_cache/` with AES-256-GCM keyed from the identity. Decrypt on-the-fly for display, decrypt-to-destination on Save. SQLCipher already encrypts messages/metadata, but downloaded attachments are currently plaintext on disk

- [~] **Relay message-availability cache — opt-in encrypted offline buffer (availability, NOT authority).** MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-04 (dev). **Restart persistence 2026-09-07: the DM buffers, topic rings (frames + registration meta), opt-in retentions, push tokens and push prefs now survive a relay SERVICE restart through systemd's fd store (a memfd handed from the old process to the new one, never a file, never disk), gone on reboot or power loss; the box now runs with NO swap and NO core dumps (both were live disk paths); the relay also exits cleanly (every deploy used to be a 90 s SIGKILL). Proof `scripts/fleet_relay_restart.ps1`, codec test `relay-uws/test/test_snapshot_codec.cpp`, memory `project_relay_restart_persistence`.** **The "channel files render nothing after catch-up" bug was run down on 2026-09-05 with the fleet (`scripts/fleet_channel_file_catchup.ps1`, six gates, new probe ops `attach_file` + read-only `channel_rows`): the PRIVATE-channel path was already healthy (caption, card, then bytes on open, sender online or not), and two real holes were found and closed. (1) A PUBLIC channel's caption, edits, deletes, reactions and link previews rode only the 0x03 room broadcast, which the relay never tees into a ring, while the FileHeader rode the topic; a returning member held file metadata with no message row and the list drew nothing. `send_public_channel_msg` now sends the same signed bytes on the channel topic as well (members dedup by mid, guests keep the room copy; public-channel wire volume doubles per op). (2) A channel subscribe that beat the room join burned the connection's once-per-connection catch-up slot: the relay refuses `set_topic_buffer` and `topic_catchup` from a peer not in the room, but `relay_catchup_done` had already recorded the pull, so nothing replayed that channel until the next reconnect (a cold start opens the last channel before the socket has joined, so this was the normal path). The channel-open catch-up is now gated on `ws_room_peers` holding the room and the `RoomMembers` sweep does the pull. Harness: `channel_relay_catchup_delivers_public_channel_file_caption`, `channel_relay_catchup_survives_subscribe_before_room_join`. Still open: if the July report was a private channel, its shape (a multi-device sibling, six or more members with vault mode, or a gap near ring retention) is not modelled by the two-peer journey. Superseded 2026-07-04 note follows.** DM text/images/file-cards work, channel TEXT works in all channels, but a channel image/file delivered via ring replay still shows NOTHING in chat even after round 3 (companion message moved to the topic broadcast, header rides topic frames, harness guard `channel_relay_catchup_delivers_file_message_and_header` passes GREEN — so the remaining gap is something the harness doesn't model: likely Dart-side rendering/reload of a file row whose header arrives without bytes, or an ingest ordering issue on the real relay; next session start by diffing the harness-passing path against a real-client repro with fresh logs, checking whether the caption row + files row actually land in the receiver's DB and the UI just doesn't reload, or never land at all). Everything below this parenthetical is DONE: DMs = opt-in extended tier over the existing push buffer (500 text+FileHeaders/device, user retention 1/3/7d via `set_offline_buffer`, delete-on-replay unchanged; offline non-image DM files now buffer a metadata-only FileHeader — never bytes); channels = ONE ciphertext copy per channel in per-topic relay rings (200 msgs / 1 MB per channel, TTL-deleted — "delete once a peer fetched it" was rejected: it just moves the gap to the next member), server-owner toggle via CRDT setting `relay_catchup_secs` (Owner/Admin `ServerSettingChanged`; members register `set_topic_buffer` + replay `topic_catchup` once per connection, cleared on Disconnected); global 512 MB relay buffer budget, oldest-first eviction; RAM-only by design (nothing seizable persists, restart = clean slate). Public channels (0x03 broadcast, not topic-routed) NOT covered in v1. Harness: `dm_relay_buffer_delivers_after_sender_goes_offline_and_clears`, `channel_relay_catchup_delivers_when_all_other_members_offline`, `channel_relay_catchup_covers_all_channels`. FIELD-TEST FOLLOW-UPS (same day, after Vitalik's live test): DEFAULT ON everywhere at 3d (personal inbox + server catch-up — absent setting = on, explicit off persists; users never find the toggle and assume offline delivery is broken); catch-up ALSO fires on CHANNEL OPEN (per-channel once-per-connection gate — heals ring-registration gaps); relay 0x09 channel copies now buffer for connected-but-NOT-IN-ROOM targets (same auth→join/ghost-socket race the 0x04 DM path fixed; the full-return silently dropped copies, which made offline channel delivery look per-channel flaky); full-node FileHeader handler now writes `inline_bytes` offline images to disk (only the FCM fetch node did — desktop registered a pending stream that never completed, so buffered images rendered as nothing). ROUND 2 (same day, dual-peer log analysis): MLS group config now tolerates late/replayed delivery (`out_of_order_tolerance` 5→512, `max_past_epochs` 0→3, upgraded onto loaded groups via `set_configuration` — OpenMLS defaults made ring frames older than newer-consumed traffic or an epoch bump PERMANENTLY undecryptable: the A-side SecretTreeError / B-side WrongEpoch failures); channel FileHeaders moved from 0x03 room broadcast to subgroup-aware 0x07 topic broadcast (they never entered the rings — buffered channel files showed captions with no file card); `topic_catchup` gained a client-watermark `max_age_secs` filter (stops whole-ring re-replay + SecretReuse noise every reconnect); opted-in DM image buffer cap 1→8. ROUND 3: channel FILE companion messages ("[file:...]"/caption) moved from targeted per-member `send_raw_to_identity` fans (offline members got NOTHING — the replayed header had no message row to hang on, chat showed nothing) to the same `send_mls_broadcast_topic` path as normal text; guard test `channel_relay_catchup_delivers_file_message_and_header`. Iron rule distilled: anything that must reach OFFLINE channel members rides 0x07 topic frames — 0x03 room broadcasts and targeted direct sends are invisible to the rings. Original design rationale follows. Generalizes the EXISTING push `offline_buffer` (RAM, 100 text + 1 image/peer, 24h TTL, replays on room join) into a user-tunable feature that solves the "Alice online / Bob offline (and vice versa)" sync gap WITHOUT a peer needing to be online to serve history. **The load-bearing line: the relay is an availability HELPER, never a source of TRUTH.** It buffers the same E2EE, Ed25519-signed bytes it already routes; the receiver verifies every signature + merges via CRDT exactly as if a peer served them → the relay can't forge (sigs), can't read (E2EE), and if it withholds, the receiver still eventually gets it from a real peer. If it vanishes, the server/DM still works P2P, just slower for offline catch-up. NO new SPOF, NO new authority — distinct from the rejected stranger-federation and from "relay as source of truth" (which WOULD reintroduce the SPOF + a seizable authority the CRDT model deliberately avoids). **Constraints:** opt-in PER INDIVIDUAL, OFF by default; user-set max retention; **text + FileHeaders only, never file bytes** (bytes = RAM/bandwidth bomb; the file itself still syncs P2P when both peers online). **Privacy holds** (same guarantees as push): peer IDs anonymous, content E2EE, relay sees ciphertext only — no Apple/Google-style content exposure. **Scope:** RAM-based like push; NOT default on the official relay if it grows large (per-server opt-in storage = the line 2014 volunteer pool, separate); a server owner could also point their server at their OWN storage relay while members keep their main official-relay connection for friends/other servers (per-server relay routing = the client-side relay-selection bullet line 2146, scoped per-server). **Defer until servers have real offline-member pain — zero users feel this today.** See `project_relay_availability_cache.md`, session discussion 2026-06-22. NEW: no syncing of file bytes from the other online peer when he's online

- [x] **Large-server scaling Tiers 1–3 (2026-07-06).** Investigation proved the 50k wall is O(N) relay fan-out, NOT MLS (plaintext auto-downgrade REJECTED — see `reports/LARGE_SERVER_SCALING_2026.md`). Shipped same day: **T1** every MLS commit fan-out rides ONE `SendToRoom` via `broadcast_mls_commit()` (wire `epoch` guard — receivers at/past it skip instead of re-bootstrapping; join SendDirect 161/550/904 → 162/482/774, per-msg slope 2.5 → 2.0); **T2** CRDT ops flood the WebRTC mesh (data-channel type 0x04 `GossipCrdtOp`, op-newness bounds propagation, same author-permission ingest as relay ops, relay fallback when mesh isn't up — also killed the O(N²) receiver re-forward loop); **T3** ICE route class feeds `PeerScore.is_direct` (direct +0.15 / unknown +0.075 / TURN 0) so 300s rotation drifts toward directly-reachable peers. T4 (relay bandwidth sharding) remains the infra plan. Live 2-machine mesh-flood + route-bias check = manual pass pending.

- [x] **Cross-machine message ordering — Lamport chat clock (2026-07-06).** Two desktops rendered the same DM thread in different orders: live view = arrival order, reloaded view = signed-timestamp order, and ~3.6s clock skew stamped replies BEFORE the messages they answered. Fix: `src/chat_clock.rs` — sends stamp `max(now_us, highest_seen + 1)` (ts = stamp/1000, order_us = stamp — ONE stamp so no ordering key can disagree); `observe()` at the two storage insert choke points covers every ingest path; seeded from DB max at start_node; +5min clamp vs future-poisoning. Old stored rows keep their signed stamps (not rewritable); truly concurrent sends have no canonical order and converge on reload. See `feedback_chat_clock_lamport`.

- [ ] **Relay multi-loop scaling (SO_REUSEPORT) — DEFERRED design epic.** The relay runs ONE uWebSockets event loop (one vCPU); the other 3 vCPUs idle. Multi-loop = N threads each binding 443 via `SO_REUSEPORT`, kernel load-balances new connections across them → ~Nx throughput for accepts/TLS-handshakes/frame processing, removing the single-loop head-of-line that caused the bootstrap stall even after the WS-discovery fix. Does NOT improve RAM/conn (stays ~13.4 KB; adds small fixed per-loop overhead). **The hard part / why deferred:** `RelayState` is currently lock-free *because* it's single-threaded — multi-loop forces a decision between (a) per-loop state sharding (rooms/peers partitioned per loop; cross-loop routing needed for peers on different loops) vs (b) shared state behind locks (risks regressing the clean linear 13.4 KB/conn scaling that the no-locks design achieved). Needs a proper design discussion before implementing, like the multi-device epic. Not urgent at current load (~2 conns, ~0 CPU). WS-based discovery already fixes the user-visible symptom.

- [ ] **Volunteer full-file storage pool — opt-in 24/7 super-seeders for a server (NOT federation).** Distinct from both the built erasure-coding (shards spread across peers, no one holds the whole file) and the existing 512 MB shard-hosting default. This is FULL-replication hosting: a member with a NAS / always-on box opts in via an admin/settings panel to dedicate a chosen folder as a high-capacity holder of a server's complete (still-encrypted) file set, so content stays available + fast even when no ordinary peer is online. Builds on the existing `~/.hollow/files/` full-replication layout + the configurable storage cap (raise 512 MB → e.g. 100 GB). **Design it as a POOL from day one (N volunteers combine storage + bandwidth), never a single host** — one seeder = an accidental central server (single point of failure); a pool = resilient mesh that preserves the no-central-server principle. **The host holds ENCRYPTED data only** — they're a holder, not a trustee; only server members with MLS keys can read it. That `hosting ≠ trusting` line is what keeps this Hollow-shaped and NOT a betrayal of the mission (and why it is NOT federation: no independent server identity/state syncing between servers — just members who hold more of the same server's encrypted files, same MLS group, same relay, same E2EE). Admin panel: per-volunteer pledged capacity, current usage, online status, combined pool headroom. Caveat to watch: availability ≠ centralization, but a thin pool creates a soft dependency — encourage ≥2-3 volunteers per server. See session discussion 2026-06-12.

**Deliverable:** A polished, feature-complete communication platform ready for public release — with private, encrypted P2P file sharing that rivals torrent performance without any of the privacy/legal exposure.

### Phase 7: Distribution & Launch

**Goal:** Ship it.

- [X] Windows installer (Inno Setup EXE)
- [X] macOS DMG (signed + notarized)
- [X] Linux (Flatpak; maybe AppImage + Snap soon)
- [X] Android (direct APK; Play Store soon)
- [X] Accessibility (screen reader support, high contrast)
- [ ] iOS (TestFlight + App Store)
- [ ] Documentation (user guide, FAQ)
- [ ] Security audit (third-party review of E2EE implementation - OTF Security Lab etc.)
- [ ] **Theme system** — structured theme manifest (colors, fonts, spacing, radii, optional cosmetics like profile decorations/nickname accents), `.hollow-theme` bundle format (manifest + asset files, signed for integrity), in-app import/export UI with live preview, curated community gallery repo on GitHub. Per-user local only — themes never travel with messages. Data-only schema (no HTML/CSS/JS, no arbitrary code execution) so community-shared themes are provably safe to apply. Absorbs the old "hearts/sparkles on profiles + custom fonts" idea as one set of knobs among many. Build on existing `HollowTheme` ThemeExtension by making it loadable from a manifest instead of hardcoded.
- [x] Landing page / website (updated for public alpha — download button pulls from manifest.json, license key gating removed, Patreon/Ko-Fi as optional support)
- [X] **Strip / minimize bundled ffmpeg binary** — Initial bundled binary (BtbN LGPL static, `vendor/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-win-x64.exe`) is ~164 MB unstripped and includes a huge codec/library zoo we don't actually use (libdav1d, libvpx, libsvtav1, libplacebo, vulkan, opencl, AMF, NVENC/NVDEC, libjxl, libwhisper, librav1e, libopenh264, all the audio codecs, etc.). After the video preview pipeline is shipped and stable, profile what ffmpeg arguments / codecs our actual usage requires (just thumbnail extraction via libwebp encoder + a small set of video demuxers/decoders for whichever container formats users actually upload), then either (a) strip the existing binary with `strip` to drop debug symbols (~15-20% reduction), or (b) build a custom minimal ffmpeg with only the required components (`--disable-everything --enable-encoder=libwebp --enable-decoder=h264,hevc,vp9,av1 --enable-demuxer=mov,matroska,webm` etc.) — target ~10 MB per arch. Same for macOS/Linux when those builds happen. No code changes needed when swapping the binary — just replace `vendor/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-{platform}` and rebuild.
- [X] LRU-eviction (optimization for loading only what you can see on the screen such as friends profiles or avatars). EDIT: should work, i remember it from all the optimizations in one of the reports. ugh, this entire document feels like a mess. at least it has some proper checkboxes to remember so that's good.
- [X] **Integration test harness** — integration test, fully implemented.

### Open-Source & Sustainability

**Licensing:**
- [X] Open-source client under AGPL-3.0 (forks must publish source — kills closed-fork theft)
- [X] Relay stays MIT (thin uWebSockets glue, encourages self-hosting adoption)
- [X] Dual license: AGPL default, commercial license for companies that don't want copyleft obligations
  - Small business / startup: ~$1k/year (non-AGPL license, no source disclosure requirement)
  - Enterprise: custom pricing (SSO/SAML, 2FA integration, priority support, custom stuff), contact collab@anonlisten.com
- [X] Add LICENSE (AGPL-3.0) to repo root + MIT LICENSE in relay-uws/

**Self-hosting:**
- [X] Add configurable relay URL in app settings (self-hosted relay = isolated network, no cross-contamination with official)
- [X] Docker Compose one-command setup: relay + certbot (auto Let's Encrypt) + coturn (TURN)
- [X] Self-hosting documentation (docs/self-hosting.md or repo wiki)

**Sustainability (donation-funded, no feature gates):**
- [ ] Credits tab in Settings — Blender-style donor/sponsor wall (tiered: Supporters, Sponsors, Contributors)
- [X] Patreon / Ko-fi / GitHub Sponsors for individual donations
- [ ] Infrastructure sponsor program (companies providing dedicated servers get logo in Credits)
- [X] No paywalls, no cosmetic microtransactions, no user-facing limits — full app for everyone

**Credibility & launch:**
- [X] Proper README with feature grid, architecture diagram, screenshots (visual repo presentation)
- [ ] Apply for cryptographic audit
- [X] Clean repo pre-launch (remove secrets, debug hacks, dead code paths)

📋 INFRASTRUCTURE MASTER PLAN: "The Swarm"

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
Horizontal scaling with identical cheap VPS instances. No vertical scaling, no mega-servers, no single points of failure. A swarm of small OVH boxes combines CPU, RAM, and bandwidth into one logical network — mirrors Hollow’s own distributed architecture. Every box runs the same self-contained binary, same config. Need more capacity? Add another box. Box dies? Clients auto-failover to the next one.

THE HARDWARE: OVH unmetered VPS fleet. Current box: 4 vCPU AMD EPYC Genoa / 8 GB / **1 Gbps** at $8.50/mo (grandfathered — the identical SKU now lists at $10/mo). Upgrade tier: **6 vCPU / 12 GB / 2 Gbps at $14.50/mo**. These are the only two SKUs that matter. N identical boxes = N× bandwidth + N× RAM. 10 boxes at $14.50 = $145/mo = 20 Gbps aggregate + 120 GB aggregate RAM. 50 boxes = $725/mo = 100 Gbps + 600 GB RAM. No Cloudflare, no load balancers, no third-party anything between users and the relay.

**Port history (2026-08-04):** OVH lifted the current box from 400 Mbps to 1 Gbps for free as part of a product-range change — RAM and vCPU untouched, one reboot from the customer console to apply. Verified on the live relay at **854 Mbps down / 827 Mbps up**. Note this is an *instance property*, not a rebuild: bandwidth and RAM come from the SKU, so a tier change is a reboot, not a migration. Nothing in the relay measures it — `virtio_net` reports no link speed, so `bandwidth_cap_mbps` in `http_handlers.cpp` is a hand-maintained constant. Bump it when the port changes.

DNS: Hostinger (already hosting anonlisten.com). One A record per relay node. Round-robin distributes initial connections; client-side ping+load logic handles real routing after that.

STUN VS TURN BANDWIDTH REALITY: ~85-90% of home users connect via STUN (direct P2P) — zero bandwidth cost to us. Only ~10-15% need TURN (corporate/university symmetric NATs, some mobile carriers). At 100k concurrent users: ~5% in voice/video = 5,000 calls, ~10-15% need TURN = ~500-750 relayed calls, mostly audio (~100 kbps) = ~75 Mbps. Even 75 simultaneous 1080p screen shares through TURN = ~450 Mbps. Total worst-case TURN load for 100k users: ~525 Mbps — one $10 VPS handles it. The "bandwidth eating everything" fear only applies if ALL traffic goes through the relay, which it doesn’t — WebRTC is P2P by design.

---

MEASURED BASELINE (2026-04-15, pre-optimization, Nginx TLS → Axum relay):
Tested at 10,000 concurrent loopback connections on current OVH VPS (4 vCPU / 8 GB / 400 Mbps — the port was 400 Mbps at measurement time; the same box has been 1 Gbps since 2026-08-04. RAM/CPU figures below are unaffected).
- **133 KB RSS per connection** at the relay process alone
- **186 KB per connection** through the full Nginx → relay path (+53 KB Nginx proxy overhead)
- **~50 bytes/sec** sustained per idle connection (auth keepalive + occasional CRDT chatter)
- **CPU:** 800 auths/sec per thread (3200/sec on 4 threads). CPU is ~13× over-provisioned vs RAM.

**Current configuration (2026-05-01):** uWebSockets C++ relay with native OpenSSL TLS on port 443. Nginx removed. Measured: **~13.4 KB/conn** relay process RSS (with `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS`). Verified with 44,600 simultaneous authenticated connections — perfectly linear scaling, 0 failures, 0 drops. Previous: Nginx TLS on 443 → Axum relay on 8080 = ~175 KB/conn (13× worse). See `relay-uws/BENCHMARK.md` for full methodology and data.

Jemalloc tested and rejected (2026-04-28): ~149 KB/conn (worse due to arena pre-allocation overhead for long-lived connections).

**Current capacity (13.4 KB/conn, after Step 5 uWebSockets rewrite + SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS, verified 2026-05-01):**
| Box | Connections | $/mo |
|---|---:|---:|
| OVH VPS 8 GB (current) | **~572k** | $8.35 |
| OVH VPS 12 GB | **~878k** | $12.75 |
| 10× OVH VPS 12 GB swarm | **~8.78M aggregate** | $127.50 |

Per-user cost: ~$0.0000015/user/mo on 12 GB OVH at scale. Bandwidth ceiling (~50 B/sec × 878k = 43.9 MB/sec = 351 Mbps) is under 1 Gbps.

Previous capacity (175 KB/conn, Steps 1-3): 40k / 62k / 620k. Step 5 achieved 12× density improvement.

---

RELAY OPTIMIZATION PIPELINE (ordered — each step builds on the previous):

- [x] **Step 1: Bounded mpsc channels (stability fix, 2026-04-29).** Switched from `mpsc::unbounded_channel()` to `mpsc::channel(32)` with `try_send()`. Caps worst-case per-conn memory under broadcast storms. Slow consumers get dropped; client auto-resyncs via CRDT/gossip on reconnect.

- [x] **Step 2: TCP socket buffer tuning (2026-04-29).** Listener socket sets 8 KB recv/send buffers via `socket2`; accepted connections inherit them. Kernel doubles to ~16 KB.

- [x] **Step 3: Nginx tuning (2026-04-29).** Reduced Nginx per-conn overhead from ~53 KB to ~39 KB:
    - `proxy_buffering off`, `proxy_buffer_size 1k`, `proxy_request_buffering off` on `/ws`
    - `ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m`, `ssl_session_timeout 1h`
    - `gzip off`, `reset_timedout_connection on`
    **Nginx remains required for TLS — do NOT attempt native TLS in the relay.**

- [x] **Step 4: Raw mio event loop rewrite — ATTEMPTED AND REVERTED (2026-04-29).** Full relay rewrite with `mio::Poll` + `Slab<Connection>` + custom WS frame parser, plaintext only behind Nginx. The WS handshake, auth, room routing, and binary protocol all worked correctly. However, the single-threaded event loop could not match tokio’s concurrent per-connection write draining:
    - **Write buffer starvation:** In tokio, each connection has its own async task that independently flushes its socket. In mio’s single-threaded loop, while processing incoming messages from peer A, peer B’s write buffer fills up with queued broadcasts but never gets flushed until the next poll iteration. Under burst traffic (reconnect → room re-join → sync), write buffers overflow within ~1 second.
    - **Eager flushing attempted:** Added inline `write()` calls after every queue operation. Still overflowed because a single `write()` may only drain a few KB (WouldBlock), while the burst queues tens of KB per frame across multiple rooms.
    - **Conclusion:** A single-threaded relay that handles both reads AND writes in one loop fundamentally cannot match the concurrent write-drain behavior of tokio’s per-connection tasks. The mio approach would need multi-threaded work-stealing or dedicated writer threads — at which point you’re reimplementing tokio. **Do not re-attempt a from-scratch Rust WS relay.**

- [x] **Step 5: uWebSockets (C++) relay rewrite (2026-04-29).** Replaced the entire Axum/tokio/tungstenite + Nginx stack with a standalone C++ binary using [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets). Native TLS via OpenSSL — Nginx completely eliminated. Ed25519 verification via libsodium, HMAC-SHA1 TURN creds via OpenSSL, JSON via nlohmann/json.
    **Architecture:** `relay-uws/` — standalone C++ binary (636 KB, 1,377 lines). Same wire protocol (JSON text + binary 0x01/0x02). Same HTTP endpoints. Same auth. Zero client code changes. Single-threaded epoll event loop. Backpressure via `getBufferedAmount()` (64 KB soft cap) replaces Rust’s `mpsc::channel(32)`.
    **Measured per-conn cost: ~13.4 KB relay RSS** (with `ssl_prefer_low_memory_usage = 1` → `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS`).
    Load tested at 44,600 concurrent connections on OVH VPS (4 vCPU / 8 GB) on 2026-05-01. Zero failures, zero drops. Perfectly linear scaling from 0 to 44.6k (limited by client-side port exhaustion on same machine, not relay). RSS grew from 17 MB (idle) to 614 MB (44.6k conns). See `relay-uws/BENCHMARK.md`.
    | Box | Connections | $/mo |
    |---|---:|---:|
    | OVH VPS 8 GB (current) | **~572k** | $8.35 |
    | OVH VPS 12 GB | **~878k** | $12.75 |
    | 10× OVH VPS 12 GB swarm | **~8.78M aggregate** | $127.50 |
    **Improvement over previous stack:** 175 KB/conn → 13.4 KB/conn (13× density). Nginx removal freed ~400 MB idle RAM. Relay idle RSS: 17 MB (was 5.2 MB relay + 410 MB Nginx = 415 MB). Certbot switched to `--standalone` with deploy hook to restart relay on cert renewal.

- [ ] **Step 6 (future, low priority): WebSocket permessage-deflate compression (RFC 7692).** uWebSockets supports this natively — change `.compression = uWS::DISABLED` to `uWS::SHARED_COMPRESSOR` in `ws_handler.cpp`. However, `SHARED_COMPRESSOR` adds ~3-4 KB per connection for the compression context (bumps 13.4→~17 KB/conn, reducing capacity from ~572k to ~451k). Encrypted payloads (ciphertext) don't compress well, so the main benefit is on JSON control messages (join/leave/members) which are infrequent. **Probably not worth the RAM tradeoff** — binary framing (Step 7) already captured the big wins. Reconsider only if bandwidth becomes a bottleneck before RAM does.

- [x] **Step 7: Binary message framing for Msg/Direct (2026-04-30).** Replaced JSON `Msg`/`Direct` envelopes with compact binary frames. Client sends `0x03` (broadcast) and `0x04` (direct) with null-terminated room/peer strings and raw payload (no base64). Relay forwards as `0x05` (broadcast from) and `0x06` (direct from), inserting sender peer ID. JSON `Join`/`Leave`/`Members`/`PeerJoined`/`PeerLeft`/`Auth` kept as JSON for readability.
    **Measured savings:** 25-42% bandwidth reduction depending on payload size (42% for short messages, 25% for large payloads). Zero CPU/RAM cost. Backward compatible — relay still accepts JSON Msg/Direct from old clients.
    Existing `0x01` (binary broadcast) and `0x02` (binary direct stream) paths unchanged — used by `ws_stream_transfer.rs` for file/shard streaming.

---

SWARM IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

- [ ] **Inter-relay gossip mesh (the core engineering work).** Each relay node maintains persistent TCP connections to every other relay node. When a `Msg` or `Direct` or binary frame arrives for a room, `ws_handler.cpp` checks if any room members are on remote nodes and forwards via the mesh. Requires:
    - [ ] **Relay discovery config.** Each relay gets a `--peers` CLI arg or reads a `peers.json` file listing all other relay endpoints (IP:port pairs for the internal mesh, NOT the public WSS port). Hot-reload on file change so new nodes can join without restarting existing ones.
    - [ ] **Internal mesh connections.** On startup, each relay connects to all peers via persistent TCP (or internal WS). Reconnect with exponential backoff on drop. Authenticate via shared secret or mutual TLS to prevent rogue nodes. At 100 nodes this is 99 connections per node — trivial.
    - [ ] **Room membership sync.** Each node tracks which peers are local vs. remote. On `Join`/`Leave`, broadcast membership deltas to all mesh peers: `{event: "join"|"leave", room, peer_id, node_id}`. Each node maintains a `remote_members: unordered_map<room, unordered_map<peer_id, node_id>>` so it knows where to forward.
    - [ ] **Message forwarding.** When `ws_handler.cpp` broadcasts a `Msg` to a room, after sending to local members, iterate `remote_members` for that room, deduplicate by target node, and send one copy per remote node (that node fans out to its local members). Same for `Direct` — look up target peer’s node, forward once. Binary frames (`0x01`/`0x02`) use the same path.
    - [ ] **Consistency guarantee.** Room membership is eventually consistent — a brief window where a peer has joined on Node A but Node B doesn’t know yet. Acceptable for chat (message arrives on next sync). If stronger guarantees are needed later, add sequence numbers per room.
    - [ ] **Mesh protocol format.** Reuse the existing binary prefix scheme: `0x10` = mesh membership delta, `0x11` = mesh message forward, `0x12` = mesh direct forward, `0x13` = mesh heartbeat/health. Keep it simple — no JSON on the internal mesh, pure binary framing.
    - [ ] **Per-node RAM state must pick a home or replicate (added 2026-08-28).** Everything the relay holds is RAM and per box: license `keys.json` (rsync or mesh-push it so the 30 s panic button fires fleet-wide), temp nickname claims, the availability cache (offline DM buffers + `0x07` topic TTL rings: a join on node B must replay what node A buffered, so either hash rooms to a home node for buffering or replicate buffers over the mesh), `reports.json`. Decide per item before the second box exists. (2026-09-07: the availability cache and push tokens now survive a restart of ONE box via the systemd fd store snapshot; that is per box and answers nothing here, but the snapshot codec is the obvious wire form for a mesh replica.)
- [ ] **Multi-process `SO_REUSEPORT` on a single box.** Run N relay processes (one per core) on the same port. The kernel distributes incoming connections across processes. Each process is independent and single-threaded. **Requires the inter-relay mesh** — without it, peers in the same room could land on different processes and messages wouldn’t route. With the mesh, each process acts as a separate node in the mesh, forwarding cross-process traffic over localhost. On a 6-core VPS: 6 processes × ~750k conns = ~4.5M theoretical (RAM-limited to ~750k on 12 GB, but auth throughput scales to ~2,400 fresh TLS/sec or ~9,000+ resumed/sec). Implement after the mesh is working.
- [ ] **Room affinity / consistent hashing (optional, 10+ nodes).** Hash server/room IDs to prefer routing users of the same Hollow server to the same relay node. Reduces cross-node forwarding traffic. Implement via client-side relay selection using a published hash ring. Not required for correctness — only for efficiency.
- [ ] **Client-side relay selection + failover.** The client (`ws_client.rs`) currently connects to a single hardcoded relay. Changes needed:
    - [ ] **Relay list.** Hardcode an initial list of relay endpoints in the client (or fetch from a bootstrap endpoint). Can start as simple as `["wss://relay1.anonlisten.com", "wss://relay2.anonlisten.com"]`.
    - [ ] **Ping + load check.** On startup (and on reconnection failure), ping each relay’s `/health` endpoint. Pick the relay with best combination of lowest latency and lowest reported load. Cache the choice in memory — no need to re-ping until disconnection.
    - [ ] **Load reporting.** Extend `/health` or `/server-stats` to include current connection count and a "capacity percentage" so clients can avoid full relays. If a relay is at >90% capacity, client skips it and picks the next best.
    - [ ] **Failover.** If the current relay drops and reconnection fails after N attempts, re-ping the full list and pick the next best. Room membership and message state resync via existing gossip/CRDT on the new relay — no special migration needed.
    - [ ] **No relay pinning required.** Because the inter-relay mesh handles forwarding, a user can be on any relay and still reach any room. The client doesn’t need to know which relay other users are on.
- [ ] **Coturn isolation.** TURN traffic (voice/video relay for peers behind symmetric NATs) competes for the same pipe as signaling. Deploy Coturn on a separate dedicated OVH VPS ($8-12/mo) — isolates bandwidth contention, separates abuse-complaint blast radius, allows independent scaling of media vs. signaling. Co-locating is fine while user count is low; separate once TURN bandwidth becomes measurable.
    - [ ] **Peer lock across nodes (added 2026-08-28).** Every coturn now allows ONLY its own host addresses (`allowed-peer-ip`, see the volume-fairness entry), so two allocations on different nodes cannot exchange packets. Multi-node: each node's coturn allows every sibling's exact addresses (never a provider /64 prefix, other customers share it), and the `turn_credentials` reply carries that node's own TURN URI so TURN follows the WS node the client picked. With CAKE on every node, pipe contention is already fair-shared; the separate-box argument is blast radius and independent scaling only.
- [x] **Volume fairness per node, no quotas (2026-08-28).** Part of the per-node recipe from now on: `hollow-cake.service` = `tc qdisc replace dev <nic> root cake bandwidth <N>mbit besteffort dual-dsthost`, with N = ~90 percent of the MEASURED raw egress (32 parallel curl streams, read `/sys/class/net/<nic>/statistics/tx_bytes` deltas over a 20 s window, never the nominal port or a single-source number). Current box measured 2026-08-28 with cake removed: 1047 Mbit egress (Cloudflare `__up` sink), 882 Mbit ingress (`proof.ovh.net`), so cake runs at 950 Mbit. The earlier 827 Mbit figure was the download SOURCE throttling. New boxes: measure first, then set. The 10 GB/day per-IP budget is gone (see the 2026-08-28 entry above); coturn peer lock + `no-tcp-relay` ship with every node.
- [ ] **Containerization + Kubernetes (deferred to 10+ nodes).** Not needed for 2-5 boxes — manual `scp` + `cmake --build` + `systemctl restart` works fine. When the time comes:
    - [ ] **Dockerfile.** Multi-stage build: C++ builder stage (`cmake + make`), minimal runtime stage (debian-slim). 636 KB binary + OpenSSL/libsodium shared libs. Expose port 443. Mount `keys.json`, `peers.json`, and TLS cert dir as volumes. Env vars: `TURN_SECRET`, `PUBLIC_IP`.
    - [ ] **OVH Managed Kubernetes (free).** Free control plane, up to 100 nodes, 99.5% SLA. Only pay for the VPS worker nodes themselves.
    - [ ] **K8s manifests.** Deployment + Service + ConfigMap. Rolling update strategy with `maxUnavailable: 1` so the mesh never loses more than one node at a time.
    - [ ] **Health probes.** Already have `GET /health`. Add mesh connectivity status (how many peer nodes connected) to `/server-stats` for K8s readiness checks and monitoring.

SCALING ROADMAP:
- **Phase A — current → ~500k concurrent users:** stay on the $8.50 VPS (4 vCPU / 8 GB / 1 Gbps port; measured raw 2026-08-28: 1047 Mbit egress, 882 Mbit ingress, cake shaped at 950). Current capacity ~572k at 13.4 KB/conn (verified with 44.6k simultaneous connections, perfectly linear scaling). Don’t upgrade. The free 400 Mbps → 1 Gbps port bump gave this phase 2.5× the egress headroom at no cost, so RAM is now the only thing that ends Phase A.
- **Phase B — 500k → 878k concurrent:** upgrade to OVH VPS 12 GB / 6 vCPU / 2 Gbps ($14.50/mo). Single-process capacity: ~878k connections. With `SO_REUSEPORT` multi-process (requires mesh): auth throughput scales 6× but RAM remains the bottleneck. Alternatively add a second 8 GB VPS for geo-redundancy.
- **Phase C — 878k → 3M concurrent:** 3-5 OVH VPSes across EU/NA/APAC regions. ~$44-73/mo. Each box runs multi-process with the mesh. Coturn on a separate box if TURN traffic is measurable.
- **Phase D — 3M+ concurrent:** grow the swarm. 5-10 OVH VPSes. ~$73-145/mo. Containerize + move to OVH managed K8s (free control plane) for orchestration.

- [x] **VPS tunable limits checklist (verified 2026-05-01, updated after 44.6k stress test).** All verified on current OVH VPS:
    - **systemd `LimitNOFILE`:** ✅ set to 1048576 (supports ~524k connections at 2 FDs each).
    - **systemd `MemoryMax`:** ✅ unset (infinity).
    - **Kernel `fs.file-max`:** ✅ 9223372036854775807 (effectively unlimited).
    - **Kernel `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`:** 32768-60999 (~28k). Fine — relay is inbound-only (accept, not connect). Raise to 1024-65535 when inter-relay mesh is deployed (relay becomes an outbound client).
    - **Kernel `net.core.somaxconn`:** ✅ raised to 65535 (was 4096, raised during 50k stress test).
    - **Kernel `net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`:** ✅ raised to 8192 (was 512, was dropping SYN packets under burst connections).
    - **Kernel `net.core.netdev_max_backlog`:** ✅ raised to 5000 (was 1000).
    - **Kernel `net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse`:** ✅ enabled (helps recycle TIME_WAIT sockets faster after stress tests).
    - **Swap:** ✅ 2 GB swapfile at `/swapfile`, persisted in `/etc/fstab`. Safety net for near-capacity operation.
    - **Load-gen client side** (for re-tests): `ulimit -n 500000` before running stress test. The bench tool is at `relay-uws/bench/stress_test/`. When running client on same machine as relay, widen port range: `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65535"` (restore to default after). For >64k connections, run client from a separate machine.
    - **~~Nginx~~ REMOVED (2026-04-29).** uWebSockets C++ relay handles TLS natively on port 443. Certbot uses `--standalone` with deploy hook.
- [ ] **Post-quantum key exchange (ML-KEM / Kyber).** All current key exchanges use Curve25519. If quantum computers break elliptic curve crypto, intercepted ciphertext could be decrypted retroactively. **MLS side:** OpenMLS 0.8.x already ships an X-Wing ciphersuite (`MLS_256_XWING_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519`, ML-KEM + X25519 hybrid) via the `openmls_libcrux_crypto` provider — swap crypto backend + enable the ciphersuite. **DM side:** vodozemac has no PQ support; wrap Olm key exchange with a hybrid ML-KEM layer manually (use `ml-kem` crate). Key sizes grow (ML-KEM-768: ~1,184 B pubkey, ~1,088 B ciphertext vs 32 B for X25519) but only during session establishment — symmetric ratchet overhead unchanged after. Signal (PQXDH, 2023) and iMessage (PQ3, 2024) have shipped PQ for 1:1 chats, but no consumer app has shipped post-quantum MLS group ratcheting yet — Hollow would be first. Low priority, future consideration.
- [ ] **Traffic analysis protection (theoretical, not planned).** TLS protects message *content* but not *timing and size patterns*. A network observer (ISP, state-level) watching both parties can correlate packet timing to infer who is chatting — even without decrypting. Mitigation would be constant-rate padding (dummy traffic), but at 572k connections even 1 pkt/sec padding = 572k pkt/sec of waste. No consumer chat app (Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram) implements this. **For censored regions, the proxy/tunnel approach (Phase ???) is the practical solution** — it hides *which service* you're using, which is a far more actionable threat than timing correlation. Not a launch blocker.

**Deliverable:** Public release across all platforms.

### Phase ???: Fight Government Censorship

**Goal:** Allow Hollow to reach its relay from inside countries with advanced DPI censorship (Russia/TSPU, China/GFW, Iran, UK/OSA).

> **Full design & decision report:** `reports/ANTI_CENSORSHIP_TRANSPORT_2026.md` (deep-research: 105 agents, 24 sources, 25 adversarially-verified claims, 2026-07). This section is the summary; the report is authoritative.

**The reframe (this is the whole point):** The problem is **not** IP blocking — it is **inner-traffic fingerprinting**. TSPU/GFW inspect the *shape* of the traffic inside the tunnel (TLS-1.3-over-TCP to a foreign-datacenter IP, real-time flow, server-heavy volume >~15-20 KB) and block on that, regardless of the outer wrapper or the port. **Plain WSS-on-443 is fingerprintable as-is** — which is exactly why our Russian tester's packets were dropped while a VPN worked. Changing ports does NOT help (verified-refuted).

**Decision:**
- **PRIMARY transport: VLESS + REALITY (XTLS-Vision).** The only widely-deployed transport still surviving in 2026 ("disrupted-not-killed" — when Russia blocked *plain* VLESS in late 2025, REALITY kept working; providers just re-issued REALITY configs). REALITY clones a real popular website's TLS-1.3 ClientHello so middleboxes see ordinary HTTPS, and defends against GFW active probing by falling back to the genuine target site.
- **Client (Hollow app, Rust):** embed the **`cfal/shoes`** crate — MIT, single Rust codebase, has `lib.rs` + an `ffi/` module (embeddable, not just a binary), ships `reality/`, `shadow_tls/`, `vless/`, `shadowsocks/`, `websocket/`, `hysteria2`, `tuic`, and `android/` + iOS support.
- **Server (VPS, Go):** run **Xray-core** — the reference REALITY implementation, actively developed (v26.x, "Reality-Vision" framework shipped Feb 2026). Running Go on the VPS alongside the uWebSockets C++ relay and the hollow-push service is a non-issue (independent 443 listener → forwards to relay over loopback).
- **The iOS win:** stock Xray/sing-box dies on iOS because its monolithic geo-routing files blow past the ~50 MiB Network-Extension memory budget. **Hollow needs zero geo-routing — it dials ONE relay** — so a single-destination Rust transport sidesteps the exact thing that breaks everyone else on iOS.

**Certificate correction (important):** REALITY does **NOT** use our own Let's Encrypt cert — it borrows a *real external website's* cert at handshake time (`target`/`dest` SNI; a domain we do **not** own). Our uWebSockets Let's Encrypt cert stays relevant to the plain-WSS relay and to a **ShadowTLS/plain-TLS fallback** (which CAN present our own cert), but not to the REALITY path.

**Ranked plan:**
1. PRIMARY — VLESS+REALITY: `shoes` client (Rust) ↔ Xray-core server (Go, VPS).
2. FALLBACK — ShadowTLS v3 (via `shoes`' portable Rust impl) wrapping WSS with our own Let's Encrypt cert.
3. OPTIONAL — Hysteria2/TUIC (QUIC) where UDP isn't throttled (already in `shoes`).
4. AVOID (known-dead): plain Shadowsocks/SS-2022 (~95% detection since Sept 2024), VMess, AmneziaWG, OpenVPN/WireGuard, port-hopping, and DIY rustls ClientHello camouflage (reinvents REALITY badly).

**Architecture (proxy ON):**
```
Hollow Rust node ─▶ shoes client (in-process, REALITY/XTLS-Vision) ─▶ VPS:443 (Xray REALITY server)
                                                                        └─▶ loopback ─▶ uWebSockets relay
```
The node still just opens a WSS connection — it opens it *through* the local shoes tunnel when proxy mode is on. The dead `proxyEnabledProvider` (Dart) + local-tunnel→VPS→relay plumbing from the removed Shadowsocks attempt is REUSED — only the tunnel protocol changes.

**History (what NOT to re-chase):** A Shadowsocks-2022 tunnel was implemented, tested from Russia (killed by TSPU in ~20s on some ISPs), and fully removed during libp2p cleanup — that removal was **correct**. The `app_settings` table + `save_setting()`/`load_setting()` FFI were kept (used by other features). The old plan's "next step" (DIY rustls TLS camouflage) is **abandoned** — REALITY does it correctly and stays current against AI-driven TLS fingerprinting; hand-rolling it is strictly worse.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Research (2026-07): full field-status + embeddability sweep → `reports/ANTI_CENSORSHIP_TRANSPORT_2026.md`
- [x] **Spike B (interop, 2026-07-05):** Xray REALITY server (VPS `:8443`) ↔ `shoes` REALITY client (Windows) ↔ WSS tunnel end-to-end. Verified: `wss://relay/ws` upgrades **101 Switching Protocols** through the SOCKS5 tunnel and the relay processes auth — the transport carries the real relay protocol.
- [x] Re-validate field status (2026-07-05): REALITY still surviving RU (<5% detection from residential-looking IPs early 2026). Freeze heuristic now ~25 pkts / ~16 KB each dir → **XTLS-Vision mandatory** (enabled). Emerging: destination-IP **CIDR whitelisting** (the single-IP ceiling below).
- [x] Deploy Xray REALITY server on the production VPS — **separate IPv4 port `:8443`** (NOT 443; relay keeps 443, untouched — IPv6:443 rejected, RU testers lack IPv6). `dest www.microsoft.com`, X25519 key, one shortId, `flow xtls-rprx-vision`, freedom outbound → `127.0.0.1:443` relay over loopback. `systemctl enable --now xray`.
- [x] Bundle `shoes` client as a **subprocess** (not linked rlib — edition-2024/aws-lc-rs/tokio collision) + revive the Dart proxy toggle (manual entry). Desktop-first. Rust: `set_proxy_config` FFI + `node/proxy_tunnel.rs` (spawns shoes local SOCKS5) + SOCKS5 seam in `ws_client::connect_and_auth`. UI: Network settings "Anti-Censorship" card (desktop) + disabled mobile toggle. `windows/CMakeLists.txt` bundles `vendor/shoes/shoes-win-x64.exe` (built via `scripts/build_shoes.ps1`).
- [ ] **Test from Russia with the tester who confirmed the drop** (Vitalik + friend, both paste the REALITY config, restart, chat with NO external VPN). ← acceptance criterion; WireShark capture on the friend's PC if it misbehaves.
- [ ] **Spike A / mobile (deferred):** iOS/Android tunnel via shoes `ffi`/`staticlib` embed (NE 50 MiB budget; Hollow's zero-geo single-relay design is the win). Mobile toggle is disabled until then.
- [ ] macOS/Linux desktop parity: build `shoes` for those platforms + bundle (CMake blocks mirror the Windows one; the Rust seam is already platform-agnostic).
- [ ] Strategic risk (out of v1 scope, keep on radar): single known relay IP is the ceiling regardless of obfuscation — TSPU trends toward foreign-datacenter-IP correlation + IP/CIDR whitelisting; mitigations = CDN-fronting or rotating/multiple relay IPs

## 14. Threat Model & Security

### 14.1 What We Protect Against

| Threat | Protection | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Message content interception** | E2EE (Double Ratchet / MLS) | Only intended recipients hold decryption keys |
| **Metadata leakage (who talks to whom)** | Sealed sender + minimal routing metadata | Sender identity encrypted in message envelope |
| **Man-in-the-middle on key exchange** | Authenticated X3DH + safety number verification | Users can verify fingerprints out-of-band |
| **Server data compromise (member device stolen)** | SQLCipher local encryption + key deletion | Local DB encrypted, keys tied to device auth |
| **Storage shard snooping (curious members)** | Encrypt-then-erasure-code | Shards are encrypted; even reconstructing all shards yields only ciphertext |
| **Sybil attacks (fake identities flooding)** | Invite-only servers + reputation weighting | New identities can only join via cryptographically signed invites |
| **Eclipse attacks (isolating a peer)** | Diverse peer selection + anchor peers | Connect to peers across network segments; maintain trusted peer list |
| **Removed member accessing new content** | MLS epoch rotation on member removal | New epoch key derived from fresh randomness that removed member doesn't have |
| **Traffic analysis (timing/volume correlation)** | Message padding + optional chaff traffic | Fixed-size messages; optional dummy traffic (configurable, bandwidth tradeoff) |

### 14.2 What We Accept as Residual Risk

- **Removed members retain access to data from BEFORE their removal** — they likely have local copies anyway. This is standard (same as Discord, Slack, Signal).
- **A sufficiently powerful global network adversary** could potentially perform traffic analysis even with padding. Full resistance would require constant-rate traffic, which is impractical.
- **Device compromise** — if an attacker has physical access to an unlocked device, they can read decrypted messages. This is true of any E2EE system. Hardware security modules (secure enclaves) are out of scope for v1.
- **Quantum computing** — current algorithms (X25519, Ed25519) are not post-quantum. Migration to post-quantum key exchange (ML-KEM / Kyber) is a future consideration, not a launch blocker.

### 14.3 Security Audit Plan

Before public launch:
1. **Internal code review** focused on crypto implementation
2. **Third-party security audit** by a reputable firm (NCC Group, Trail of Bits, Cure53, etc.)
3. **Bug bounty program** for ongoing vulnerability discovery
4. **Open source** the cryptographic and networking layers for community review

## 15. Known Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge 1: "The Last Person Online" Problem

**Problem:** If only 1 member is online, they can only see data cached on their device. Messages sent while they were offline, stored as shards on other offline members' devices, are invisible until those members come back.

**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive local caching — cache all channels the user has visited
- **Storage Contributors** — members who voluntarily run Hollow 24/7 and donate above-minimum storage (e.g., a home NAS with 50 GB). They earn reputation and a visible role. Tiered recognition system:
  - **Storage Contributor** — donates above the server minimum
  - **Anchor Node** — consistently online 95%+ uptime, high storage donation
  - **Guardian Node** — verified high-uptime node, prioritized for critical data shards and relay duties
- These roles are tracked via CRDTs in the server state, visible in the member list, and purely opt-in. No cryptocurrency — just community reputation.
- Graceful UX — show "Waiting for network..." indicator rather than empty channels. Show locally cached messages immediately, mark gaps with "X messages may be unavailable until more members are online."

### Challenge 2: Bootstrap & First Member

**Problem:** When a server is created, only 1 member exists. There's no distributed storage yet.

**Mitigation:**
- First member stores everything locally (they ARE the server at this point)
- As members join, data gradually distributes to them
- Minimum member threshold for erasure coding to kick in (e.g., need at least k+m distinct members)
- Below the threshold, use simple replication (copies on each member)

### Challenge 3: Mobile Devices Going to Sleep

**Problem:** Mobile OSes kill background processes aggressively. A member on their phone might appear to be online but actually isn't receiving data.

**Mitigation:**
- Use FCM/APNs for push notifications to wake the app (for messages)
- Keep a lightweight background service for shard serving (may not be possible on iOS)
- Mobile members contribute less storage by default (e.g., 256 MB vs 1 GB on desktop)
- Prefer desktop members for shard storage and relay duties

### Challenge 4: Message Ordering in High-Traffic Channels

**Problem:** In a busy channel with many simultaneous senders, HLC ordering may feel "off" compared to a centralized server that assigns a strict order.

**Mitigation:**
- HLCs with NTP-synced clocks are accurate to ~10ms in practice
- For truly simultaneous messages (same millisecond), deterministic tiebreaker (peer ID) ensures consistent ordering
- Users are accustomed to slight reordering in group chats — this is not a dealbreaker
- Threads (reply chains) provide explicit causal ordering within a conversation

### Challenge 5: Storage Abuse (Member Pledges but Doesn't Actually Store)

**Problem:** A member pledges 5 GB but deletes the shard data to save space, or deliberately serves corrupt shards.

**Mitigation:**
- **Periodic shard verification:** Random spot-checks where peers request specific shards and verify integrity (hash matches content address)
- **Reputation scoring:** Members who consistently serve correct shards earn reputation. Members who fail checks lose reputation and may be deprioritized or warned.
- **Redundancy absorbs it:** With k=10, m=5, up to 5 members can be unreliable before data is at risk. Rebalancing creates new shards on reliable members.

## 16. Comparison With Existing Alternatives

| Feature | Hollow | Discord | Element/Matrix | Session | Briar | RetroShare |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Client** | Flutter native | Electron (web) | Electron/Web | Native (multi-platform) | Android only | Qt (desktop) |
| **Server model** | Distributed (members) | Centralized | Federated (homeservers) | Decentralized (Oxen nodes) | Pure P2P | Friend-to-friend |
| **Storage** | Shared across members | Company servers | Homeserver admin | Oxen swarm (14-day) | Local only | Local only |
| **E2EE** | All messages, calls, files | No (unless DM "Privacy Mode") | Optional (Megolm) | Yes (Signal Protocol) | Yes (Signal Protocol) | Yes (PGP + TLS) |
| **Identity** | Public key (no phone/email) | Email/phone | Email (or homeserver account) | Public key (no phone) | Public key (in-person exchange) | PGP key |
| **Group size** | Unlimited (MLS scaling) | 500K+ | Unlimited (federation) | 100 (closed groups) | Small (~10) | Medium |
| **Voice/Video** | Yes (WebRTC + E2EE) | Yes | Yes (Jitsi integration) | Yes (limited quality) | No | Yes (basic) |
| **Offline support** | Full (local cache + sync) | No (web client) | Partial (homeserver stores) | Yes (swarm stores 14 days) | Yes (local storage) | Yes (local storage) |
| **Installation** | Single native installer | Download + Chromium | Download + Chromium | Download native | Download APK | Download + Qt |
| **Resource usage** | Low (native binary) | High (Electron) | High (Electron) | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Open source** | Relay server open-source; client proprietary | No | Yes (Apache 2.0) | Yes (GPL) | Yes (GPL) | Yes (GPL) |
| **Data sovereignty** | Full — your data, your device, unforgeable evidence | None — Discord owns it | Partial (homeserver admin) | Partial (14-day swarm) | Full (local only) | Full (local only) |

### Hollow's Unique Differentiators

1. **Shared Vault** — No other platform distributes storage across members. This eliminates hosting costs and single points of failure.
2. **Native performance** — Flutter compiles to native code. No Electron, no Chromium runtime.
3. **Zero infrastructure** — No homeservers to maintain (Matrix), no blockchain tokens (Session), no company servers (Discord).
4. **MLS encryption** — Most modern group encryption protocol, better scaling than Signal's Sender Keys.
5. **Discord import** — Lower the migration barrier. Bring your community with you.
6. **Data sovereignty & cryptographic evidence** — No one can delete your data remotely. Exported messages carry unforgeable digital signatures. Evidence of abuse survives even if the server owner tries to destroy everything.

---

## 17. Server Lifecycle & Data Sovereignty

This section addresses a critical question: what happens when members leave, get kicked, or the owner shuts down a server? In a decentralized system, the answer is fundamentally different from centralized platforms — and it's one of Hollow's most powerful features.

### 17.1 Core Principle: Local Data Is Sacred

**Nobody can remotely delete data from your device.** Not the server owner, not admins, not other members, not Hollow's developers. Once you've seen a message and it's in your local cache, it's yours. This is a direct consequence of decentralization — there is no central server to issue a "delete from all devices" command.

### 17.2 Message Signing & Cryptographic Proof

Every message in Hollow is **digitally signed** by the sender's Ed25519 identity key:

```
Message structure:
{
  content: "encrypted message payload",
  author: Ed25519_public_key,
  signature: Ed25519_sign(private_key, content + timestamp + channel_id),
  timestamp: HLC_timestamp,
  channel: channel_id
}
```

This means:
- **Authenticity:** You can mathematically prove that a specific identity key authored a specific message
- **Integrity:** Any modification to the message invalidates the signature
- **Non-repudiation:** The sender cannot deny having sent it (they — and only they — hold the private key that produced the signature)
- **Verifiable exports:** Exported message logs carry the original signatures. A third party (law enforcement, a court) can verify the signatures independently without needing access to Hollow's network

This is **stronger evidence than Discord screenshots**, which can be trivially fabricated. Hollow messages are cryptographically unforgeable.

### 17.3 When a Member Leaves Voluntarily

```
Member chooses "Leave Server"
├── Step 1: Member's device stops syncing with the server network
├── Step 2: MLS epoch advances — member loses access to NEW messages
├── Step 3: Member keeps:
│   ├── Local cache (all messages they previously viewed — decrypted)
│   ├── MLS keys from past epochs (can re-read historical messages)
│   └── Choice prompt: "Keep local archive?" or "Free up storage?"
├── Step 4: Shards on member's device are rebalanced to other members
│   (graceful transfer before disconnection)
└── Step 5: Member can export their archive at any time
```

### 17.4 When a Member Is Kicked / Banned

```
Admin kicks member
├── Step 1: CRDT operation removes member from the server's member list
├── Step 2: MLS epoch advances — kicked member loses access to NEW messages
├── Step 3: Kicked member's device receives the kick notification
├── Step 4: Kicked member KEEPS:
│   ├── Full local cache of everything they saw (their data, their device)
│   ├── Past MLS epoch keys (can still read historical messages)
│   └── Cryptographically signed message history (verifiable evidence)
├── Step 5: Shard data on kicked member's device:
│   ├── Default: kept until member manually reclaims storage
│   └── Option: automatic cleanup after 30 days
└── Step 6: Kicked member can export their entire archive
```

**Key point:** The admin can remove someone from the server's future, but they cannot erase the past. The kicked member retains everything they had access to.

### 17.5 When the Owner Shuts Down a Server

This is where Hollow's architecture truly shines.

```
Owner initiates "Delete Server"
├── Step 1: CRDT operation marks server as dissolved (tombstone)
├── Step 2: All online members receive dissolution notice:
│   "This server has been shut down by the owner."
├── Step 3: Members see prompt:
│   ├── "Export archive" — download full message history as verifiable export
│   ├── "Keep local archive" — messages stay in local cache (default)
│   └── "Delete local data" — remove everything (opt-in only)
├── Step 4: The owner CANNOT:
│   ├── Delete data from other members' devices
│   ├── Revoke past MLS epoch keys that members already hold
│   ├── Destroy encrypted shards stored on other members' devices
│   └── Invalidate message signatures
└── Step 5: The data persists, distributed across ex-members' devices
```

### 17.6 Evidence Recovery — "The Rat Files"

In a worst-case scenario — a malicious server owner running a harmful community tries to destroy evidence by kicking everyone and shutting down the server — Hollow's architecture provides a safety net that no centralized platform can match.

**Why evidence survives:**

1. **Local cache on every member's device** — every message a member viewed is stored locally in decrypted form. The owner can't reach into their devices to delete it.

2. **Cryptographic signatures** — every message is signed by the sender's identity key. Exported messages are mathematically verifiable. Not screenshots that could be Photoshopped — actual cryptographic proof.

3. **Encrypted shards persist on ex-members' devices** — even after the server is "deleted," the erasure-coded shards are still sitting on members' storage. These shards include data from channels the shard-holding member may not have had access to (they hold encrypted chunks, not decrypted content).

4. **Members who DID have access hold the decryption keys** — MLS epoch keys from when they were members. Combined with the shards from other ex-members, they can reconstruct and decrypt the full history of any channel they had access to.

**Recovery flow for a victim:**

```
Victim was in harmful server → Owner kicks everyone → Server "deleted"

Victim's device still has:
├── Local cache of all messages they viewed (decrypted, readable)
├── MLS epoch keys for channels they had access to
└── Shard data they were storing

To recover messages they DIDN'T have cached locally:
├── Step 1: Contact other ex-members (out of band)
├── Step 2: Gather encrypted shards from their devices
│   (ex-members don't need to decrypt — just share the raw shards)
├── Step 3: Reconstruct encrypted data from k-of-n shards
├── Step 4: Decrypt with victim's MLS epoch keys
└── Step 5: Full history recovered, with cryptographic signatures intact

Evidence package for law enforcement:
├── Message content (decrypted)
├── Sender identity keys (who sent what)
├── Digital signatures (mathematically verifiable, unforgeable)
├── Timestamps (HLC — causally ordered)
└── Channel/server metadata
```

**Hollow provides a cooperative "Evidence Recovery" UI tool:**
- Guides ex-members through the shard gathering process
- Handles reconstruction and decryption automatically
- Exports a verifiable evidence package (messages + signatures + metadata)
- Can be used by any ex-member, not just the victim
- No technical knowledge required — the UI handles the cryptography

### 17.7 Data Export (For Any Reason)

Any member can export their data at any time — while in the server or after leaving:

**Export options:**
- **Messages:** Full history of all channels you had access to (from local cache + reconstructible from shards)
- **Files:** All files you uploaded or downloaded (from local cache)
- **Server structure:** Channels, roles, permissions (CRDT state snapshot)
- **Identity data:** Your profile, contacts, server memberships
- **Format:** JSON + media files in a ZIP, with cryptographic signatures preserved

**Server template export (for owners):**
- Export the entire server structure as a template
- Channels, categories, roles, permissions, welcome messages — everything except member data
- Other users can import this template to create a new server with the same structure
- Useful for community templates ("Gaming Server Template," "Study Group Template," etc.)

### 17.8 Server Lifecycle Summary

| Event | Data on member devices | Access to new messages | Evidence integrity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Member is active** | Full sync + local cache | Yes | Signatures verifiable |
| **Member leaves voluntarily** | Kept (user choice to delete) | No (MLS epoch advances) | Full — signatures + local cache |
| **Member is kicked** | Kept (cannot be remotely deleted) | No (MLS epoch advances) | Full — signatures + local cache |
| **Owner shuts down server** | Kept on ALL ex-members' devices | N/A (server dissolved) | Full — shards + keys + signatures persist |
| **Owner kicks everyone THEN shuts down** | Still kept — owner can't delete others' data | N/A | Full — decentralized architecture prevents evidence destruction |

---

## 18. Sustainability & Monetization

Hollow has no servers to pay for, no infrastructure bills, and no company overhead. The project sustains itself through community support, not paywalls.

### 18.1 Core Principle: No Features Behind Paywalls

Everything that makes Hollow work — E2EE, Shared Vault, voice/video, screen sharing, file sharing, unlimited servers — is free. Forever. No "Hollow Nitro."

### 18.2 Revenue Model: Donations + Optional Cosmetics

**Donations (primary):**
- Patreon / Ko-fi / Open Collective for recurring support
- In-app donation option (similar to WholesomeStoryADay's Wall of Kindness model)
- Transparent spending reports (community trusts where their money goes)

**Optional cosmetics (supplementary):**
- Custom profile themes / colors
- Animated avatars
- Exclusive badge frames
- Custom emoji packs (create and share your own)
- Profile effects / banners

**Critical constraint:** Cosmetic purchases must NOT compromise privacy or security:
- No telemetry, no tracking, no purchase history linked to identity
- Purchases are handled via anonymous payment methods where possible
- Cosmetic data is stored locally / in the user's encrypted profile, not on a central server
- Payment processing is the ONE external service — use privacy-respecting providers (Stripe with minimal data, or crypto payments)

### 18.3 What Keeps Costs Low

- No servers = no hosting bills
- No data storage = no cloud costs
- No moderation team = no staff costs (community self-moderates)
- Open source contributions reduce development burden
- The only real costs: developer time, code signing certificates, app store fees ($25 Google, $99/yr Apple), domain name

## Appendix C: FAQ — Questions & Answers From the Design Process

These are real questions that came up during the design of Hollow, answered in full.

---

### Q: Will calls be high quality? Is this old-school VoIP?

**No, this is NOT old-school VoIP.** Hollow uses WebRTC — the exact same technology powering Discord, Google Meet, Zoom's web client, and Facebook Messenger calls.

- **Audio:** Opus codec — the best audio codec in existence. Adaptive bitrate from 6 kbps (bad internet) to 510 kbps (studio quality). Same codec Discord uses.
- **Video:** VP8/VP9/AV1 with hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding.
- **Adaptive bitrate:** Automatically adjusts quality in real-time based on network conditions.
- **Built-in processing:** Echo cancellation, noise suppression, jitter buffer, automatic gain control.

Hollow actually has a **quality advantage** for small calls — 1:1 and small groups are direct peer-to-peer with no server in the middle. Lower latency than Discord, which routes everything through their data centers.

---

### Q: Can screen sharing do 4K at 60fps or 120fps?

| Resolution | FPS | Bitrate Needed | Realistic? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1080p | 30fps | ~3-5 Mbps | Easy, works for most people |
| 1080p | 60fps | ~6-8 Mbps | Good for most broadband |
| 1440p | 60fps | ~10-15 Mbps | Needs solid internet both ends |
| 4K | 30fps | ~15-20 Mbps | Doable with good connection |
| 4K | 60fps | ~25-40 Mbps | Needs excellent upload AND download |

**120fps:** WebRTC caps screen capture at 60fps in most platform implementations. Even Discord doesn't do 120fps. For screen sharing (not gaming), 60fps is already buttery smooth.

**The real bottleneck is upload speed.** With P2P, there's no server compression — what you send is what they get. Good internet = crystal clear. Bad internet = WebRTC gracefully degrades (lowers resolution/fps automatically rather than stuttering).

Game streaming at 1080p 60fps is very doable — Discord Nitro-level quality, for free.

### Q: Will 30,000+ member servers work?

**Yes.** The system is designed to get BETTER with scale, not worse:

- **Storage:** 30K members × 1 GB minimum = 30 TB raw pool (~18 TB usable). Massive.
- **Redundancy:** With 30K members, aggressive erasure coding (k=20, m=30) makes data essentially indestructible.
- **Availability:** Thousands of members online at any moment. The "last person online" problem disappears.
- **Relay:** Hundreds of publicly reachable members available as relays at all times.

**What scales well:**
- DHT peer discovery: O(log n) — 30K is ~15 hops vs ~7 for 100 members. Barely noticeable.
- MLS encryption: O(log 30000) ≈ 15 tree operations per membership change. Fine.
- Storage pool: linearly better with more members.

**What needs attention at scale:**
- CRDT operation volume in busy channels — solved by channel-level sharding (each channel is its own CRDT document).
- Peer connection management — you connect to a subset (6-12 peers), not all 30K.
- Gossip-tree topology for large voice channels — more peers = more forwarding paths = better redundancy.

**Bottom line:** If the system works well at 100 members (because it's properly designed with correct shard spreading, storage optimization, and efficient sync), it works at 30K. The architecture doesn't change — the numbers just get more favorable.

### Q: What about file transfer speeds?

Two paths depending on the situation:

- **Small files in chat** (images, short clips): Sent directly P2P to online members. Instant, same as any chat app.
- **Large files** (stored in Shared Vault): Encrypted → erasure coded → distributed. Upload takes longer due to coding + distribution overhead. For a 100 MB file with good peers online, roughly 5-15 seconds.
- **Cached files:** Download once from the network, it's instant after that. Frequently accessed files stay in local cache.

### Q: Will Hollow drain mobile data?

Hollow is configurable per-device:

- **Storage contribution:** Lower on mobile (256 MB default vs 1 GB desktop).
- **Shard serving:** Optional on mobile — can be disabled on cellular, enabled only on WiFi.
- **Sync scope:** Configurable — sync all channels vs only active channels on mobile.
- **Calls:** Audio ~1-3 MB/minute (same as any call app). Video varies with quality setting.
- **Background data:** Minimal if shard serving is disabled on cellular.

### Q: Is there a member limit?

No hard limit. Practical experience by scale:

| Size | Experience | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1-50 | Excellent | Everything smooth, full mesh for small calls |
| 50-200 | Great | MLS handles encryption efficiently |
| 200-1,000 | Great | Shared Vault becomes very robust, huge storage pool |
| 1,000-5,000 | Good | Need good anchor nodes for reliability |
| 5,000-30,000 | Good with tuning | Channel-level CRDT sharding recommended |
| 30,000+ | Workable | Sweet spot for the architecture, benefits from scale |

Discord's 500K+ servers work because they have massive infrastructure. Hollow trades that for decentralization — the sweet spot is communities up to tens of thousands, which covers 99.9% of real Discord servers.

### Q: What about bots and integrations?

Not in the initial plan, but the architecture supports it naturally:

- A "bot" is just another peer with a special role — it runs Hollow's protocol, receives messages, can respond.
- Self-hosted by anyone (run it on a Raspberry Pi, a VPS, whatever).
- No bot API server needed — the bot IS a member of the server.
- Integrations (GitHub webhooks, RSS feeds, etc.) would be bot-peers that bridge external services.
- This could be Phase 8 or a community-contributed feature.

### Q: What about privacy, criminals, and government requests?

This is the most important non-technical question for any E2EE platform.

**The reality:**
- Hollow's developer has ZERO access to any user data. By design. There are no servers to raid, no databases to subpoena, no logs to hand over.
- This is identical to Signal, Briar, Session, and Tor — all legal, all operating, all with the same answer to law enforcement: "We can't hand over data we don't have."

**Legal protection:**
- Building encryption is protected in most democratic countries. The legal fight was largely won in the 1990s "Crypto Wars."
- Section 230 (US) and equivalent laws elsewhere protect platform builders from liability for user-generated content.
- Precedent: Signal, Tor, Mullvad VPN, WireGuard — all zero-knowledge, all legal. When Mullvad was raided by police, officers left with nothing because there was nothing to take.

**What Hollow DOES do:**
1. **Clear legal terms** — Hollow is a communication tool. Users are responsible for their conduct.
2. **Client-side reporting** — members who witness illegal content can screenshot and report to law enforcement directly. Hollow can include a "Report to Authorities" button with guidance. The people who CAN see the content (members) are empowered to act.
3. **Community self-moderation** — server owners/admins have full moderation tools (kick, ban, delete messages, manage roles). The community polices itself.
4. **Invite-only servers** — no public server browser, no discovery tab. You can't stumble into a bad server. You must be explicitly invited.

**What Hollow does NOT do (and must never do):**
- No backdoors. A backdoor for law enforcement IS a backdoor for hackers and state actors.
- No client-side content scanning. Destroys the trust model, can be repurposed for censorship.
- No metadata collection "just in case." If you don't have it, you can't be forced to hand it over.
- No age verification. Requires central identity verification, destroys the decentralized model, and doesn't work anyway.

**The ethical position:**
> "We build tools that protect privacy. We don't control how people use them, just like a locksmith doesn't control what people put behind locked doors. The answer to bad actors having privacy is not to take privacy from everyone — it's better policing, better education, and communities that self-moderate."

**The practical reality:** People who would use Hollow for criminal purposes are ALREADY using encrypted tools. Hollow doesn't enable anything new. What it DOES do is give the 99.99% of normal people the privacy they deserve.

**Open source commitment:** The cryptographic and networking layers will be open-sourced for full transparency. Anyone can verify there are no backdoors.

### Q: What makes Hollow different from all the other "Discord alternatives"?

Most alternatives are just reskins of the same architecture:

| Alternative | What it really is |
|---|---|
| Revolt | Web client + centralized servers (just Discord with different branding) |
| Guilded | Was promising, got acquired by Roblox |
| Element/Matrix | Powerful protocol, but federated (homeservers), Electron client, designed-by-committee UX |
| Spacebar | Literally reimplements Discord's API |

**Hollow's actual differentiators:**
1. **Shared Vault** — No other platform distributes storage across members.
2. **Truly native** — Flutter, not Electron. 50-80 MB, not 300 MB.
3. **Zero infrastructure** — No servers to host, no cloud bills, no company that can shut down.
4. **The community IS the server** — members collectively host, store, and relay. The more members, the stronger and faster the server gets.
5. **E2EE everything** — not optional, not partial. Messages, files, calls, screen shares. All of it.
